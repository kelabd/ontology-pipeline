Dr. Naomi Myhill: problem. You got a little makeshift desk in the car as well.
Aubrey Shannon: Oh yeah, we've got all the like stands and the holders and like I can work from anywhere. But just don't ask me to record a video using Google because I can't figure that out.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: You're good.
Aubrey Shannon: So funny.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: You're good.
Aubrey Shannon: Um, just bear with me. For whatever reason, I'm getting a lot of of this like spinny wheel for Sean's uh PDF just like popping it trying to pop it out of the chat from before. Let me just see if I can get there's another tab here that has his blood work. Sean's final report linked here. Okay. Okay. So, let's do um his kind of cardiovascular markers. So, I'm not sure if you have it um all pulled up here, but uh we'll just start with his lipid panel.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yep.
Aubrey Shannon: And so, that is where at the very top we have cholesterol total. So our total cholesterol is is all of our kind of free fatty acids that are traveling around um within the blood vessel and the total cholesterol in like a very rudimentary way can be um kind of part and parcelled into HDL and LDL.
 
 
00:01:56
 
Aubrey Shannon: However, there are other molecules like LP little A which is an LDL molecule bound to another type of cholesterol called an APOB molecule. And so when we're looking at all of the um nuances in and around cholesterol, we want to look at the different types of cholesterol and uh think about interventions and the risks that are associated with the different types of cholesterol. And so we know that our HDL cholesterol is our high density lipoproteins. And our high density lipoproteins are the ones that are a little bit more buoyant. they are not as um tightly packed and they're not as small as our lowdensity lipoproteins. And so our HDL in general is considered our good cholesterol. And so we want our good cholesterol to be high and we want our LDL, which is our lowdensity lipoproteins, to be low. and our cortisol levels um can impact and so can vitamin D the way that the liver packages up these HDL and LDL molecules. And when we're low in vitamin D, we can actually see a preference for the liver to create LDL molecules opposed to HDL molecules.
 
 
00:03:13
 
Aubrey Shannon: So this is where I like to do that kind of segue where we look at vitamin D and then we look at cholesterol afterwards. And it's also why it's like critically important for us to check um vitamin D when we are doing a cholesterol panel. We also know that when we have high cortisol, our body tries to upregulate our circulating cholesterol because we our cholesterol is essentially our fats and our fatty acids are what we burn for energy. And so in an athlete like Shawn where he's a very high stressed individual, we're going to oftentimes see high cholesterol because cholesterol is also uh not only a part of the the um energy dynamics within the body, but it's also the precursor to our hormones like our cortisol and our testosterone. And so there are these evolutionary mechanisms that um that keep our cholesterol around uh and and um stop us from packaging up our cholesterol. So high cholesterol and high stress and low vitamin D is a common thing for us to see when we look at the risk ratio of cholesterol to um to uh LDL or HDL.
 
 
00:04:25
 
Aubrey Shannon: So that's that cholesterol risk ratio. Um that risk ratio tells us about how much of our cholesterol is kind of like that dangerous cholesterol and those are the more like low density lipoproteins. And so we want to see that number um below 3.5. And whenever that number, that cholesterol risk ratio number is greater than 3.5, it's telling us that we have too many of those low density lipoproteins comparative to our overall cholesterol number. And this increases our risk of having a cardiovascular event because those tiny little HDL molecule or sorry, those small little LDL molecules are the ones that are more inflammatory and the ones that cause more vascular damage. And so when we see these numbers and in someone like Shawn, we're thinking like what kind of interventions do we want to do? And the nice thing is that through the cascade panel, we actually look at how much fish oil this person is getting because our fish oils um are help the liver determine if they're going to make LDL or HDL molecules. And so when we go down and we look at his omega check in his whole blood, which is looking at his EPA, his DHA, and his DPA, so all of the different types of fatty acids that are traveling through the blood, we see that that number is is on the low low side.
 
 
00:05:54
 
Aubrey Shannon: Like we want that number to be greater than 5.5. The reference range is 3.8 to 5.4. And so any time that that number is less than 5.5, we know that his consumption of his saturated fats comparative to his good anti-inflammatory fats like his EPA and DHA is out of whack. And so that also contributes to the liver's ability to um package up those fats into the HDL and LDL molecules. And so we would ask someone who has a omega check that is less than 5.5 to reduce their saturated fat intake to less than 20 gram per day. And we would ask that individual to increase their intake of fish oil to greater than 3,000 mg per day. And in someone like Sean's case where he's already taking a fish oil, we then look at the quality of that fish oil and whether it's in a capsule or whether that fish oil is in a liquid. And then if it's in a capsule, we understand that we need really good stomach acid. And we need awesome lipes, which is one of the enzymes that comes off of the liver um to be able to break that capsule down, emulsify that fat, and then bring it across the blood gut barrier.
 
 
00:07:16
 
Aubrey Shannon: So, in this instance, um, we made those changes for him because his fish oil wasn't potent enough and then his fish oil was in a capsule instead of in a liquid. Does that make sense?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah. All good. What would be the the kind of follow-up timeline on that to see if that intervention had had helped?
Aubrey Shannon: So, it usually takes about 3 months to see a a good change. And so, we would wait a full 3 months before we would do a retest. And then what's also kind of critically important is the 24 hours like beforehand actually do matter when we're doing this type of a test. So we do try to ask individuals to have a like a typical dinner um the night before and they need to fast for 12 hours. And so if for example they had um the night before it was like their birthday and they went to the keg which is like a chain restaurant in North America that's like steak and French fries and cheesecake and then alcohol can also impact uh the body's ability to package up these cholesterol molecules.
 
 
00:08:34
 
Aubrey Shannon: And so then 12 hours before they did the test, they had high high saturated fat, then that could impact the test results as well. And so that's where we we would want to also just give them that little bit of extra information and saying, "Hey, you know, in your instructions, we need a fasted blood draw, 12 hours fasted, and please have more of like a typical last meal as opposed to having something that's that um is atypical." And so if their typical meal is the cake, like we need to know that, but um but we really want people to to have something that's that is like very uh typical of what their regular meals look like. Um and then we start looking at some of the little nuances um between the different types of lipoproteins. And so LP little A, which I mentioned, is an LDL molecule bound to an APOB molecule. This is our most dangerous cardiovascular um lipoprotein because this one's the most associated with an creating an aoscllerotic plaque. And so when we look at Shaun's tests for example, his lipoprotein A is 13. The reference range is less than 75. And from an optimized perspective, we want this number to be less than 30. And lipoprotein A is one of the um cholesterol molecules that's most associated with a genetic predisposition.
 
 
00:10:07
 
Aubrey Shannon: And so when we look at Shaun's lipoprotein profile, his LP little A being low is telling us that his dis um lipidmia is more associated with functional. So, dietary high intake of cholesterol, a high need for testosterone production over exercise and stress as opposed to it being rooted in a genetic predisposition. So that's why instead of putting him directly onto a statin drug, so five milligrams of of a statin, we are trying supplement and lifestyle interventions first to see if we can reverse some of these numbers as opposed to us saying this is irreversible and we need to be on a medication to protect to pro protect your cardiovascular system. Um when we think more about lipoprotein A, we know that lipoprotein A when it does create an atheroscllerotic plaque, there's a marker that we can actually test to give us an indication of the inflammation that is being created by plaques that are currently in in the in the person's um vascule. And this is called LP plaque 2 activity. And so you'll see this in his um in his test as being elevated and this is at 196. The reference range is less than 123. And so in this case it's telling us that we can have some curiosity about potential plaque formation.
 
 
00:11:54
 
Aubrey Shannon: um even though his LP little A is low, it may be that some of his other LDL molecules have created plaques or he we can also see this elevate for people that have heavy metal toxicity because our heavy metals will deposit in the in our vascule. And so there is an enzyme called serapeptidase. And this enzyme is a proteolytic enzyme that actually can break our plaques down and break down the inflammatory markers that are associated with the upregulation of this LP plaque 2 activity. And so he is on a we've um told him to take a supplement called inflam control. and inflamm control uh contains the serapeptidase. And so the intervention when we see that this number is elevated is two capsules of the inflam control which needs to be taken away from food by 30 minutes. So if we took inflamm control with food, the serapeptidase would actually just go in and literally break down our food as instead of it traveling passing the blood gut barrier traveling through the vascule and and impacting our inflammatory mediators.
 
 
00:13:15
 
Aubrey Shannon: And so that's a thousand or 10,000 international units as the therapeutic dose for cerapeptidase. So again, we're going to have him on that for three months. And then once the three-month time frame has lapsed, we're going to look at retesting and seeing if we've had an a profound impact on that LP plaque 2 activity. LP plat 2 activity can also be um manipulated with the fish oil. And so we're getting like kind of like that twofur action where the fish oil should help with the packaging of the HDL comparative to the LDL. and then also see some reduction in that plaque 2 activity as well. Um so that kind of summarizes his um his markers on the cardiovascular front and then we've done the vitamin D front and then um the next one that we test or the next thing that we look at is kind of the glucose and the um creatinine and albammen and globbulin and all of that kind of stuff. So, it's really important for us to test a fasting glucose and test a fasting insulin.
 
 
00:14:31
 
Aubrey Shannon: And one of the challenges is that oftent times um these two markers aren't tested um handinhand with one another. We just do a fasting glucose or we just do a fasting insulin. And so this is going to be for some of our health seekers that aren't necessarily professional athletes but are in andropause or in pmenopause or menop or in menopause because as we see a decline in some of our sex hormones. We also see challenges with the body's ability to take our glucose and burn our glucose and our um by our muscle cells. And so glute 4 receptor activity h has some is there's control there with estrogen. There's also some mechanisms in and around like cortisol and our ability to bring our fatty acids and our blood glucose um within the muscle cell to be burned for energy. And so if we're only testing circulating glucose, but we're not testing circulating insulin, we can miss out on an opportunity to witness either glucose intolerance or insulin sensitivity. And so in a fasting glucose, we want to see that number uh on the low side.
 
 
00:15:49
 
Aubrey Shannon: And so the reference range here is 65 to 99. His is coming in at 88. That's great. So mid-range is is something that we're looking for as mid-range is ideal. Um his fasting insulin isn't actually highlighted on the summary page that I have here. Um oftent times we see a lowered fasting insulin uh in our athletes which is is totally healthy and normal. So our athletes will typically have really good blood sugar regulation. But if we see a high fasting insulin or a an a fasting insulin in the upper 75th percentile of the reference range along with a mid-range or high fasting glucose, then we know that we have in um we've reached a place where the the muscle cells are not sensitive to that insulin. And so we're kind of knocking on the door of type 2 diabetes at that time. This would be an indication for us to onload chromium and bourberine. And so there's uh a couple of supplements that have a combination of that product. And so inflam or um through ATP they have a supplement called glucose control.
 
 
00:17:03
 
Aubrey Shannon: And glucose control is an excellent product because it helps us with the bourberine side of things, but it also helps us with the um it also contains the chromium which kind of sensitizes glute for receptor. So bourberine is like our natural GLP1. Um it works at helping uh with blood sugar regulation and blood sugar management. And then the um chromium is helping us with activation of the glute 4 receptor. So the recommended dose on bourberine is 500 mg with each meal. And then the recommended dose for chromium is 1 milligram three times a day. and it's chromium colonate which is like the best form um to help us with the regulation of our blood sugar. Let me go back now. Sorry, flipping through some screens here. Um then the next thing that we're looking at is our creatinine. And creatinine is a pro is is a marker of the filtration um that's happening at the level of the kidney. And so we want the kidney to retain um and recycle creatinine.
 
 
00:18:27
 
Aubrey Shannon: And when we are seeing creatinine um elevated in the blood, it means that the kidney is not filtering properly. So that we have instead of this like tiny little civ, we have kind of larger holes within the kidney. And so the whenever we see these like higher creatinine levels, which is what we saw with Shawn, it can be a variety of things. It can be that there's been muscle turnover. So in muscle turnover, we see an elevation in creatinine. And so that can be an explanation. It can be that the kidney isn't functioning properly. So we have poor filtration through the kidney. And so that's where we think about kidney diseases where we see high creatinine. It can also be a measure that looks at dehydration. And so when we see an elevated creatinine, um the first thing that we should do is look at some lifestyle pieces. And so we want to look back at the red blood cell count, the hematocrit and the hemoglobin. And we want to see if this person is dehydrated.
 
 
00:19:32
 
Aubrey Shannon: So if hematocrit and hemoglobin and red blood cell count are all in the upper 90th percentile, we think, okay, maybe this person is dehydrated. And so we have the person hydrate and we do a retest. It really only takes about 3 days to see a change in creatinine. We also want to ask the the patient if they've exercised prior to doing the blood draw. And so if that's the case with exercise and dehydration, we can literally do a retest three days later and ask the individual um to reduce exercise and ask the individ individual to be highly um uh uh hydrated. And then that and then if we see that higher creatinine, um we need a further medical workup. And so we would do a urine analysis to look to see if there's something going on at the level of the kidney from an infectious perspective. And then if it's still if we still see in the urine that there's blood that there is white blood cells um if there's proteins then this is a urology referral. If the creatinine um just continues to be high but the UA is looking healthy and normal um we and we can also do macroscopic and microscopic UA.
 
 
00:20:55
 
Aubrey Shannon: So microscopic UA will actually look to see if there are um any cancer cells within the urine. Then we think about really powerful antioxidants to help with kidney uh function. And those antioxidants include vitamin A, C, E, and zinc. Selenium can also be very helpful for the kidney. And so can aloe. And so aloe vera um is it's found in a lot of like different combination products, but the company Designs for Health actually makes like an aloe vera capsule um which can soothe inflammation within the kidney as well. Some of the dietary interventions that we might want to think about is reducing protein intake. And so this is a really like challenging thing to do with our athletes because we want our athletes to have high proteins in order to undergo hypertrophy, but we know that pro that a high protein diet can be really hard on the kidney as well. So it's it's definitely a bit of a balancing act. Um, but kidney disease is something that I'm sure we will come across as we're like continuing to do this higher level of screening for individuals.
 
 
00:22:08
 
Aubrey Shannon: And so it it is something um that we would kind of look at on a case by case basis if that makes sense.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah. Um, I'm just a question, a followup really. I know you said hydration could affect the value of creatinine. Could other things affect it like demographic, like sex for example, age? Are any of those factors? Do you take those into consideration when you look at those results?
Aubrey Shannon: You know, it's it is interesting like sex doesn't typically have an impact. Um, but as we age, kidney function does decline, but it doesn't mean that like an elderly individual would have high creatinine just because of their demographic. it's usually that that demographic has other things going on like muscle wasting and dehydration and so there isn't this like expectation that every elderly person would have high creatinine. However, if you went into a um assisted living home and the general population was in between the ages of 80 and 103, chances are you would see high creatinine across the board.
 
 
00:23:24
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, that that makes sense. Um, so I know you mentioned there you the the high protein diet could could be something that you would change. Obviously that's quite a balance with with athletes. So would your approach to interventions be different for athletes than health seekers or would it be based off of what their goals?
Aubrey Shannon: totally because I think with health seekers we aren't asking a health seeker to have 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body mass plus like an extra 20 grams of protein um after exercise.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah.
Aubrey Shannon: And so for health seekers, health, you can be healthy on 0.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body mass. Um, and so looking at like other ways of of trying to um supplement and find interventions. And so for a health seeker, it might just be looking at reducing their protein intake and then all of a sudden like their creatinine is healthy and normal. But for an athlete, it's going to look like what are all of the interventions that we can layer in to protect the kidney from the their high protein diet.
 
 
00:24:34
 
Aubrey Shannon: Um, we don't want to ask an athlete to reduce their protein intake, but we also don't want to push them into into kidney disease because of the their nutritional their high net nutritional needs.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah. No, that makes sense. Thanks, Aubrey.
Aubrey Shannon: Um, and then there's another marker that kind of fits directly into this and that's the uh blood ura nitrogen and creatinine ratio. So creatinine is one of the waste products um within our blood that is related to muscle turnover. Um but blood ura nitrogen is a waste product that's more associated with um with liver with liver function. And so if there's a high ratio of blood ura nitrogen to creatinine, this can suggest that there is a a more of a problem um associated with the kidney's ability to filter the blood properly. But if there's a low ratio, then this can more point towards things like um uh a liver problem. So the liver uh either liver disease or um it can also pro uh approach things like malnutrition or like a really low protein diet.
 
 
00:25:58
 
Aubrey Shannon: And so it's nice to see for someone like Sean like his blood ura nitrogen ratio is looking very healthy and normal. And so this um this also helps us to see that, you know, there isn't likely a diseased state that's happening here. Like there isn't likely a diseased state with the liver. There isn't likely a diseased state with the kidney. This is probably more functional like dehydration or more functional like um he like having had exercise like um prior to doing the test. The reference range for blood ura nitrogen the ratio reference range is 6 to 22 and his came in at 13. Then the next things that we look at is sodium and potassium. And so sodium and potassium um these are markers of kidney function as well. Um throughout the process of the kidney filtering the blood um sodium and potassium are excreted and reabsorbed. And so again, like these numbers looking very healthy and normal um are telling us that they're pro that the that the likelihood of them having kidney disease or kidney um a kidney problem is quite low.
 
 
00:27:11
 
Aubrey Shannon: The uh chloride, carbon dioxide, um calcium, these are also markers of kidney function. So is total protein. And so these are all looking healthy and normal for him as well. and albumin and globbulin. These are um proteins that are created at the level of the liver. And so albumin and globulin are important things for us to look at for just overall liver function and liver health. And then the ratio of albamin to globulin um also helps us to speak to the um health of the liver. And so uh el sorry elbummen is um is is actually like a a recycle product that the liver makes and then the globulin is an antibbody that is created by the liver. And so looking at the ratio between those these two things also gives us an indication of of how well the liver is functioning. Um in and so kind of I feel like I need to explain that a little bit better. Um, but maybe what I'll do just for kind of sake of time is we can like go back to those where I can kind of give a little bit more detail because there's um implications for like immune function and things like that too.
 
 
00:28:31
 
Aubrey Shannon: And so maybe I'll do like a bit of a deeper dive on like albumin and globulin. And then um Billy Rubin is the recycling of our red blood cell. And so, uh, when our Billy Rubin is high, this can also speak to dehydration, but it can also speak to liver dysfunction. And so I think there's some nuances that I'd like to give better detail in for kind of the albamin globulin billy rubin versus the other markers which is the alkaline phosphotase a and alt because one subset is like disease state and inflammation of the liver which is the alkaline phosphotase as and alt and can be associated with cancers and um and can be associated with uh fatty liver disease. and can be associated with uh tumor and blockages like um like gall stones whereas like the other one is more associated with the actual like operation of the liver and uh and its ability to um create amunogabulins, package up fats and things like that. So maybe our maybe if we can do another one where I just talk a little bit more about nuances of liver.
 
 
00:29:49
 
Aubrey Shannon: Um that would be awesome.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, definitely. We can definitely follow up on those over
Aubrey Shannon: Okay. And then I think the last kind of stuff was more of the like testosterone estrogen dihydroxy testosterone. And so I wonder if we could and DHEA. And so I think for that I'm wondering if maybe we can regroup on those pieces cuz I'd like to actually tie that all back into his cholesterol um like we did when we had uh the call with him. And I think that would take like about 10 minutes to do that. But I think that's what will set us apart from a lot of like the other um kind of AI programs. Like there's ones here where like you can do a little blood spot. It's called True North. And it doesn't like make those connections. And so I think um I want to do a really good job of like helping us to be able to tie those pieces together so that when we're like treating testosterone or we're treating liver, we know we're also like treating testosterone and we can do we can have like a tight link between like how the supplements would be the same.
 
 
00:31:10
 
Aubrey Shannon: If that makes sense.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, I think that's 100% what we want. We want to be able to link them all and that's that's how it's going to work in the ontology. That's the aim. So, yeah, let's regroup on those ones. I've noted them down as well. Um, I know we're coming up to the hour now. So, um, yeah, I feel like that went really quickly actually.
Aubrey Shannon: It goes so fast.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Um, it does.
Aubrey Shannon: It's insane.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: It does. It's so interesting when when you're describing it as well. You do a really good job of linking like the mechanism to the the value and then the intervention with it as well. So, I really don't have to jump in with many questions because you're you're going through it quite quite naturally, which is which is good. Um, sh so should we try and get a followup um into the calendar now?
Aubrey Shannon: Yeah.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: just while while you're on
Aubrey Shannon: Yeah. These like this Thursday morning spot is like pretty good. Like I'll typically have to do it from my car because my nanny arrives at 3:15 at 9:00, but my toddler doesn't go to an activity until 9:30.
