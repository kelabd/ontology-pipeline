Ontology Knowledge Gathering Interview - Mollie - Transcript
 

Dr. Naomi Myhill: so Molly, let's let's get started. Um so first question as as part of our ontology interview is what are your primary areas of focus um and expertise. So in this answer if you can kind of give us the domain names and description of where your expertise lies that would be great.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. Yeah. So, um, so my area of expertise and focus is lifestyle medicine and how it relates to optimal health and functioning. Um so obviously that's very broad and spans a number of areas but that you know the lifestyle medicine refers to um six areas of lifestyle nutrition physical activity sleep stress reduction stress management um substance use reduction and positive social connection. So I leverage those elements of lifestyle and optimizing those those um th those you know functions in in our lifestyle um to prevent disease but also treat conditions that may already be existing and um I work you know most commonly with cardioabolic conditions so hypertension, dysipidemia, diabetes, overweight, obesity um things like that just because they're common, but of course that filters into um you know things like mood disorders, chronic pain as
 
 
00:01:51
 
Mollie Dwivedi: well. Um so my experience um and expertise outside of lifestyle medicine um relates to chronic disease management um and and prevention as well. So um I have worked in um a number of areas in both in the hospital and outpatient settings and treating mostly those conditions with um typical uh conventional western western medicine. And so my expertise really is um blending the two and using evidence-based protocols that involve sometimes medication, sometimes procedures, sometimes surgeries as needed as kind of a you know um end result. Um but to help people live their most optimal um life in terms of health span and and lifespan and using lifestyle as the foundation um for all of those things.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Great. Thanks for that. So, we'll move on to the next question now. And I think you mentioned a lot of different domains there that that you have expertise in. So, if we focus on one of those domains to begin with, and we'll probably circle back if we've got time or it might be a part two when we focus on a different one.
 
 
00:03:07
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: So, when I ask this question, if you can answer um with a specific domain in mind and let us know what that is um and then we'll go from there. So the next question is when a a health seeker comes to you and presents like a a concern, how do you typically assess them and what are the steps that you go through? Whether that is um assessments that you will do and what the purpose of that is and in this question you might answer like multiple um uh pillars and constructs together. If you can kind of just list that initial uh approach to when a health seeker has a concern.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. So if we look at a domain um I think we could use we could call um I think the the terminology for this we'll have to kind of debate um but it metabolic health which generally refers to blood glucose management I think that's the term blood glucose management management is probably the most specific um way to describe that sort of domain and of Of course in within that domain we have the spectrum of insulin resistance as it relates to um uh impaired glucose tolerance uh to pre-diabetes to type frank type 2 diabetes to you know endstage type 2 diabetes which requires exogenous insulin administration right so um and normal um
 
 
00:04:40
 
Mollie Dwivedi: glycemic control people who have nothing on that spectrum of insulin resistance but that's what I think of um when I think of metabolic health or blood glucose management um is that a good place to start do you think
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, I think that's perfect, Molly.
Mollie Dwivedi: as far as a domain? Okay.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, that would be great.
Mollie Dwivedi: Okay. So the assessments that I I do I'll start kind of with a a western um approach first because I I always lead with that. that is the you know foundation of of my training and um that's what we know really it works well to manage disease but we want to take it a step further with lifestyle medicine to go from the you know management of disease to optimal human functioning I think that's really where lifestyle medicine shines as a side note um but so in the conventional western approach I look at all of the blood glucose data that we have available to us um which is oftentimes a one-time hemoglobin A1C like that was maybe just checked in the preceding months.
 
 
00:05:41
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, but if people have multiple values available, I'll query all of their hemoglobin A1C's. Oftent times we'll see a trend um upwards from, you know, 5 to 5.1 to 5.6 to 5.7. Now, we're in pre-diabetes range. So, I'll look at that. If we have fasting glucose data, I'll look at that. If we have fasting insulin, I love that as well. So I will look at hemoglobin A1C fasting blood glucose and then uh do a calculation with a HOMA IR which is another tool um for women who um you know may have had children or been pregnant before if they've had oral glucose tolerance tests. I'll look at that. So I will look at any of these parameters that relate to to glucose um in in the conventional you know lab space. And so that gives me a good idea of what's been going on with this. Has this person had troubles with blood glucose management? If so, h how long has this been spanning? Is this the last six months?
 
 
00:06:45
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Is it the last, you know, three years? It's been slowly getting worse. Um, so that's the first thing. Um, the next thing I will look at, um, and this gets into a cardiovascular domain, so I won't spend much time going into there, but I'll look at their other cardium factors because they're often related. Um, like with a metabolic syndrome, we we often see, you know, overlap here. Um, so that gives me a good idea of um, does this person have cardiovascular disease? Do they have a lot of risk factors for cardiovascular disease? So that helps me understand the person as a whole um as a as opposed to just one siloed domain of of the blood glucose um because that doesn't tell the whole story. Um I will also look at body composition. So often BMI if but if we have an available DEXA scan to to look at their body fat percentages um and yeah so we'll take whatever sort of um anthropometric anthropometric data I can about um their body composition as well um their weight history.
 
 
00:07:49
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So have they you know lost weight and they still remain in the obese category. are they on a trajectory of gaining weight um couple pounds a year over the last five years or so. Um so we'll kind of do a big cardium metatabolic assessment um in in that regard. Um look into some family history as well um and um ethnicity also plays into this as well. Certain um you know South Asian uh populations have higher you know risks of of diabetes as well. So family history um to really understand what what what is is going on with this person. Um then I will so that's kind of the standard um you know just a medical history workup. Um and are they taking any medications that could raise their blood sugar as well? Um less common but something to to be thinking about. Um so a standard medical history thorough one. Um, and then now shifting over to the lifestyle side of things. Um, and also this is kind of um I'm not even going to mention is it just implied of course like the patient goals, patient concerns, and you know the subjective data that you collect from the patient.
 
 
00:09:08
 
Mollie Dwivedi: I'm just going to assume that that's implied in this workup. And let me know if I'm going too far down one rabbit hole or not if you want me to switch gears.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: You're good. You're good so far. Yeah, if you can just list them all again exactly what you've been doing and we'll go into detail of some of them. We probably won't get through all of them, but we'll go into detail them as well. So, yeah, carry on.
Mollie Dwivedi: Okay. Do you want me to list them?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, if you can if you can list them and then we're going to go through probably some of those in a bit more detail and I'll ask specific questions around those assessments.
Mollie Dwivedi: Okay. All right. You want to do that now?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Go for it. Yeah.
Mollie Dwivedi: Okay. So, start with basics. So vital signs um including BMI um going into body composition um so that look can look at like waist circumference or waist to hip ratio or dexa scan if we've got it available to get a a body fit body fat percentage.
 
 
00:10:02
 
Mollie Dwivedi: I'll take any sort of body fat percentage, you know, number calculated in the field because it's probably better than nothing in some cases. So even the ones at the the gyms. Um and then that is that um and then obviously medical history, family history, um medications that they're taking, things like that. Um but the more specific to blood glucose management are going to be um hemoglobin A1C, fasting, glucose, fasting, insulin, um oral glucose tolerance tests, less common. Um any sort of um yeah, that's that's about it for those. I think I covered everything.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: And based off the the assessments that you just mentioned, um what assessments would you use if you had unlimited resource? And then also which assessments would you use if you had moderate resource? So is there a a difference in kind of the level of assessments you would use based off of the resource that you or the health seeker had available?
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. Yeah, definitely. That is that's I mean that's kind of my day in day out right now, right?
 
 
00:11:14
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um so limited resources, weight, BMI, hemoglobin A1C, those are very inexpensive. Waist circumference if people are up to it. Um I would say those are easy limited resource um abundantly available um options also I mean yeah yeah moderate
Dr. Naomi Myhill: far better. Yeah. Moderate resource.
Mollie Dwivedi: yep um so moderate resource um so I also the that was my conventional um my conventional medicine dive on glucose. Now, there is the lifestyle side of that as well that I haven't talked about. Um should we do that one after?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: If Yeah, if you can just finish with the the moderate resource and then we can go back to the
Mollie Dwivedi: Okay.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: lifestyle the lifestyle ones that would be great.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah, cuz they are interconnected. like I wouldn't I'm I typically wouldn't separate those like lifestyle plus conventional western medicine I would put in as one assessment. Um
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay.
Mollie Dwivedi: but in my brain and for the purposes of this kind of like exercise I'm separating them.
 
 
00:12:35
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, that's great.
Mollie Dwivedi: Okay. Um so then moderate resources let's throw in a um let's throw in a fasting insulin. Um I would say also for the low resources fasting glucose because that's also easily available and inexpensive. Um so in the moderate resource everyone everything in the low resource plus um fasting insulin and then I would also um I mean body composition scans are probably pretty inexpensive. I would c I would call that a moderate resource. So, uh, yeah, a DEXA scan
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay,
Mollie Dwivedi: plus
Dr. Naomi Myhill: great.
Mollie Dwivedi: plus all the general medical history collecting.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Is there any other assessment um in terms of the western medicine that you've just described that doesn't necessarily fit into moderate or low resource? Is it is it a high resource for example that we haven't captured there or is are you happy that everything's been captured?
Mollie Dwivedi: So if if I if I had my brothers, I I would love to see an oral glucose tolerance test.
 
 
00:13:51
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um that gives us another piece of information that is not collected by any of those. Um which is how people respond to a blood glucose load. Um it's not particularly expensive. I don't think I actually don't know the cash price for it, but it is resource intensive. Someone has to go somewhere for about three hours for the testing. So
Dr. Naomi Myhill: That's great insight. Thanks for that, Molly. Okay. Should we circle back to the the lifestyle um medicine assessments that you would um you would go through at the same time as the western? So, we we go through that. That would be great. If you again do the same thing where if you just list them out and then just give a brief description and then we'll try and go through them all in in detail in the next few questions.
Mollie Dwivedi: yeah. Yeah. Um so and also I'll mention um you know the history taking piece of this it's not free right because it it takes a person resource to collect this information.
 
 
00:14:49
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So, um, you know, I would say things things that go in a low resource are patient goals, family history, um, medications they're taking kind of thing. In a moderate resource, I would say that's where we where we somebody takes a detailed weight management history. Have they lost or gained weight? Where are they in this in their in their weight journey? Um that is something that I think is um more of a precious resource. Um yeah. Yeah. So just to throw that in there. Um okay. So for lifestyle assessment um now this is where for um for for every patient kind of regardless of of what they're presenting with um I I like to have you know an informal interview um about each of these six pillars. So, um, you know, going through each of of the six pillars and I would like to have the lifestyle assessment that I also that created for Cascade. Um, for every single patient, I think that's a low resource. Um, I would say for the low resource the the assessment, I would say for a moderate resource, the lifestyle assessment plus um a a structured interview to dive into each of these six pillars of medicine to ask more subjective questions and followup.
 
 
00:16:29
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um now with regards to blood glucose management um there are you know the pillars that really come most to mind that are going to be most impactful are going to be nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress. Um those are really going to be the highest priority for me. Um and you know with nutrition I um you know I do a detailed kind of inventory of of um their personal preferences um any dietary preferences they have and then kind of go through 24-hour recalls of what they're eating. Um there are some other tools out there that um I haven't used formally, but I've played around with them and I I like the the logic behind them. Um so there's that and then also of course you know like food logging um with any apps um and then CGM data for the appropriate patient. Um, I wouldn't put that across the board for everybody, but it's certainly part of the equation. Um, and then physical activity. Um obviously just you know h how many minutes of you know light moderate vigorous exercise they're doing on a weekly basis if they're strength training.
 
 
00:18:03
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um you know a detailed history of of those things what they have access to what they're interested and like doing. Um and then sleep is another important one that I I think about with with blood blood glucose management. So my first question is um always does the person potentially have sleep apnea? Um do they have risk factors? Have they been tested for it? Um so that's kind of a whole another domain. But um assessment for sleep apnea is top of mind there. And then also ensuring that they're um sleeping, you know, 7 to n hours for if it's a general adult population um on a regular basis. And then stress. Uh stress is, you know, a little bit harder to to monitor and quantify, but um I like the the PSS4 that that tool that's in the lifestyle questionnaire. Um also using things like like aura ring data, but a lot of it based around kind of conversation as well. Then I'll also I'll also add for every single patient at Cascade, the other two things that I think about in addition to the six pillars of lifestyle medicine are going to be uh mental health and weight management.
 
 
00:19:19
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Those are things that I also kind of silo out universally for everyone. They're not pillars of lifestyle medicine, but they're important.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay, great Molly. So, we have a lot of assessments to talk through. So, what would be great is if we can kind of go through them one by one and the next kind of round of questions are going to be about that specific assessment and just get in more detail on how you do that assessment, the data that we collect from it. So if we start with um the blood tests, so I think you mentioned like the hemoglobin, A1C for example, um fasting glucose, fasted insulin. So if we start with those um just going to ask some questions. So firstly, what type of assessment is it? So for example, that's a blood work assessment. So it's an invasive assessment. Um so if you can give again just a brief description of the process for that. So from a patient coming in um and how they get that type of assessment and secondly what technology or tools are used for that.
 
 
00:20:28
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: So the vendor name as an example um and then the assets you get from that. Is it a PDF report? Is it sent to you via a different software type? So if you could answer those two questions for the the blood work assessments first that would be great.
Mollie Dwivedi: So um okay so hemoglobin A1C is a is a blood test um just it does not need to be collected fasting it can be collected any time of the day um and it is generated a PDF F report that is sent directly to the patient that also the clinic um any vendor will who processes blood specimens can do that. Um fasting insulin fasting glucose same thing. Um yeah same thing except for those do need to be collected fasted. Um and yeah delivers a PDF report to the patient and to the clinician. Um oral glucose tolerance test is requires that um someone go into a lab um and it it has to be a location that offers the service. So not all labs will offer that because they have to stock a glucose a 75 gram glucose drink.
 
 
00:21:48
 
Mollie Dwivedi: That is disgusting. Um, but they go there and they um they draw your blood and run a fasting insulin, fasting glucose and then you drink them. You drink the load and then you wait for two hours and you can't do any exercise. You're really not supposed to, you know, be exerting yourself more than normal. Um, and then come back and they repeat uh glucose and insulin. Now, that requires some interpretation. um unless that interpretation is done by the the lab provider, but often times they just spit out the raw values. Um and that report is then delivered by PDF to patient and provider. Um does that cover it for blood testing? I think that's everything I said, right?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yep, that does. So, just some follow-ups on on those. What specific metrics do you collect from those assessments and how do you interpret them? Is there a reference range? Um, and is that reference range different based off of the demographic of people that you're seeing?
 
 
00:22:51
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Um and then secondly or thirdly, how confident are you in kind of the validity, reliability, sensitivity, specivity of those tests to measure for um insulin resistance as an example.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. So, that's a really good question. Um, and so A1C, I'll start with that one. So easy, very simple to interpret um standard reference range um for um all adult populations. Um less than 7 5.7 is um normal. Um so 5.6 and below is normal. 5.7 to 6.4 is pre-diabetes. 6.5 and above um technically on two occasions um is is type two diabetes. Diagnostic of type two diabetes. Um man. Okay. the spec the sensitivity and specificity for A1C. I would have to look up a a table for all of that um information, but what I will say is that um hemoglobin A1C is often more of a lagging indicator of insulin resistance. And so that's where things like homir um can come in and can detect some earlier um insulin resistance than a hemoglobin A1C can and similar and I'll talk about the oral gluc oral glucose tolerance test but um so um I am quite confident in a hemoglobin A1C but you do have to look at the whole person to be sure that it completely makes sense because Sometimes it does not.
 
 
00:24:37
 
Mollie Dwivedi: And in fact, we just reviewed an athlete who um had one that was just probably um um it it was probably not an accurate reflection of his glucose management. Um so short answer, I would have to look up kind of exactly the um you know the the ranges of those in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Um so similarly with you know I I use all of these together I don't like to single them out if if if I have a choice um because similarly if um there are certain things that can cause people's um especially fasting glucose um to be you know not necessarily indicative of their of their glucose management um I would be I'm more confident about the A1C than I am honestly the fasting insulin um and um and f and fasting glucose but um they give a little bit slightly different information. Um and then the 2hour oral glucose tolerance test is something that shows you this is something that the other two tests don't show you. The oral glucose tolerance test shows you how somebody's how somebody responds to a high glucose load.
 
 
00:26:05
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, so you're looking at their fasting glucose and their fasting or their insulin in response to glucose and how it changes um over time. So you can see that when people are insulin resistant that they may have a really pronounced insulin spike compared to somebody who is is you know lower or has no no evidence of insulin resistance. Um, so that is really telling. G gives you different information than the fasting insulin and the fasting glucose and the A1C, which the A1C just gives you three months of somebody's average blood sugar um, which can be, you know, affected by a lot of things. Um, so there um, yeah, I don't I I don't know off the top of my head kind of how those rank in terms of confidence level. oral glucose tolerance test being a little bit different than the other two. Um I want to say that the oral glucose tolerance test is the gold standard um for diagnosing insulin resistance. So my guess would be that that's actually probably highest in terms of level of of evidence, but it's not widely used because it's such a pain.
 
 
00:27:17
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: That's great insight, Molly. And don't worry that you can't remember the reference ranges off the top of your head. I imagine there's so much to remember. Um,
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah,
Dr. Naomi Myhill: we can collect that offline, so that's fine. Um,
Mollie Dwivedi: I will say the homir actually I meant to mention online calculator. You plug in fasting insulin, fasting glucose, it will spit out a number and if it's less than two, then there's no signs of insulin resistance. So that home IR is very easy to calculate as well. Um and um yeah, the reference ranges for the oral glucose tolerance test I have to I have to look up because yeah, that's I don't use it very often.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: No, that's fine. Um, so the next question just based off of those assessments that you talked about and you slightly alluded to to this in some ways, but how does the health seekers current state influence the assessment or interpretation of those tests? So um for maybe kind of the hemoglobin A1C as an example, how would that health seeker state so would for example sleep deprivation have an impact on the the interpretation of the the results of that test?
 
 
00:28:25
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. Yeah. Lots to cons lots to consider there. And this is really just putting the whole person and especially kind of their medical history into context. So um it's the hemoglobin A1C is looking at how the red blood cell is glycated over three months. And so anything that affects the red blood cell affects the outcome of the test. So if people have iron deficiency, if people have cickle cell anemia, if people have um you know if people have things going on with their red blood cells, which isn't most people, but it is something that is often overlooked. Um so so any sort of hemoglobinopathy thing that affect the red blood cell um will skew your interpretation of the of the results. So that's really important to keep in mind. Um, something that is really common is people with like COPD or um, uh, severe asthma who who require a lot of oral steroids um, will often have a higher A1C as a result of the the steroid administration or chronic um, bowel diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's, um, ulcerative colitis, that kind of stuff.
 
 
00:29:41

Mollie Dwivedi: Um, so those are important things to keep in mind. Um, also, you know, like you said, lifestyle factors. Um, so, you know, for example, like in the summer when people are traveling a lot and they're not spending a lot of time cooking and paying close attention to what they're eating, um, maybe not exercising, maybe sleep deprived, you can see their A1C go up. Um, so that is important to to keep in in mind as well. Um, I will say, you know, oftent times, um, people will kind of say like, "Oh, yeah, like summer's been crazy." Well, if your A1C is is 5.8 and it was previously 5.6, I'm still pretty worried that you have a spectrum. You are on the spectrum of insulin resistance, kind of going in the wrong way. Um, even if it's even if you clean up your diet, I I still think, you know, we I worry that um that I don't worry. I I there is evidence that the person does have signs of in insulin resistance and it can be managed um but and it can be you know and sometimes reversed or put into remission is the term I like to use better but um it is influenced by lifestyle states.
 
 
00:30:51
 
Mollie Dwivedi: That being said, there that is probably on top of a on top of the spectrum of insulin resistance that's kind of at the simmering at the foundation.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay, great. So, to clarify there, there are a number of different things that you would need to assess at the same time as interpreting the results from from those tests such as those lifestyle factors, but also previous medical history um as well and medications that might be taken such as kind of oral steroid use. So, just clarifying that for the transcript so it links it up.
Mollie Dwivedi: Mhm.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Um, great. So we've come to like the end of the questions on those levels of assessments and I know there was more assessments that you mentioned. So we'll go back to I think the body composition assessments that you mentioned. So you mentioned BMI um DEXA and other ways to collect kind of anthropometric data. So if we kind of circle back on those questions. So if we start with um the BMI for example and and also talking about DEXA.
 
 
00:31:59
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: So, what type of assessment is it? Um, physical, is it a survey, wearable? How would you describe that assessment? And again, what technology and tools would you use to complete those assessments? And that might be vendor name, um, actual tools that you would use to collect that data. What does it provide in terms of the asset? So, is it a PDF again? Is it a video? Is it raw data?
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. Um, so, so body composition, you want me to start with like BMI, waist circumference, or is
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah,
Mollie Dwivedi: that
Dr. Naomi Myhill: that
Mollie Dwivedi: all?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: would be great if you start with that.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. So, weight is the raw data like to see it in trends over time. Um, and from, you know, from height plus weight, um, we can, you know, calculate somebody's BMI. So raw data trend over time um waist circumference um similarly can be done as long as somebody has access to a tape measure and instructions about how to um appropriately measure their waist circumference and you know the body landmarks and things like that to to be sure that it is accurately captured.
 
 
00:33:10
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um and yep, you know, that's just a metric um that is is trended over time. And um same waist circumference and like waist to hip ratio. Again, that's measuring at the appropriate landmarks on your waist and then also your hips. Um so that requires instruction and those do have um reference ranges by gender and uh race, ethnicity. Um and so those need to be kept um in mind and um trended over time. Um and then um so then body composition as well. um DEXA imaging study. Um I don't have any vendors off the top of my head other than the ones that Cascade has used. Um and provides um raw data um as well as a PDF report.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: That's great. Thanks, Molly. So, you you just mentioned there in terms of um specific norms or reference ranges to be demographic and or ethnicity specific when you're comparing those for kind of waist to hip ratio and and BMI. Um for DEXA as well, is there is there any specific um norms or reference ranges?
 
 
00:34:34
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: And how do you interpret the DEXA scan, whether it's it's good, poor, and do you use those words or phrases to describe kind of the results as well? Um and then what's your confidence or how confident are you in a BMI, waist to hip circumference and DEXA scan in terms of validity, reliability, sensitivity, specivity
Mollie Dwivedi: Mhm. Um so um so reference ranges. Yes. So um for um there are standardized ranges for visceral adapost tissue. I shouldn't say standard standardized but um age adjusted a****** and I think ethnicity adjusted um kind of ranges at which we see um chronic disease um indicators increase. So um less visceral adapost tissue is is better but we do see by age, sex and um maybe ethnicity um ranges at which um we want to stay reference ranges at which we want to stay below to try to minimize incidence of chronic diseases, cardioabolic conditions. Um and similarly for body fat percentages um age gender again I can't remember race ethn ethnicity but it's generally you know calculated by the report that is um that is provided there in terms of body uh body fat and uh lean mass percentages um and um confidence level.
 
 
00:36:20
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So DEX is the gold standard for determining body composition. Um as far so so I have high confidence in in that data greater confidence in um that as opposed to BMI alone. Um so if I were kind of like to rank my um my confidence I would say um BMI is the lowest uh BMI plus waist circumference or waist waist to hip ratio is you know intermediate and then dexa being the highest um confidence level. Does that answer everything?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yes, that's great, Molly. Thanks for that. And I think what we'll probably do after this is after this interview is circle back offline for links to those reference ranges and things as well. So again, don't worry if you can't remember them off the top of your head. We'll circle back on that. Um,
Mollie Dwivedi: Yes.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: and then just final question based off of those body composition assessments. Um, how does the health seekers current state influence those assessments and your interpretation of them?
 
 
00:37:26
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. So this is where weight history becomes really important. Um putting a person into the context putting the result into the person's context of their weight history is critical. Um, and the reason for that is there's a lot that we do not understand about weight management and people's potential or trajectory and we truly never know how low we can get somebody's weight to a place that they can maintain for the rest of their lives. It's of it's very common for people to regain weight after having successfully lost. is unfortunately very very very common. So um I think that is is really critical before providing somebody results. You want to understand where they are. Have they just lost 100 pounds and their BMI is 35? Well, that's a huge win for that person. Um as opposed to somebody, you know, who is on the trajectory of gaining weight and we want to kind of slow that down or, you know, reverse it. Um so that is is critical is is where they are in their weight journey.
 
 
00:38:42
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um and of course the surrounding life stressors and life events as well. If people have you know gained a bunch of weight because of um um you know extraneous life life circumstances. That's really important to know too. figure out the best way to support them in order to um interpret or in order to pro provide them with a plan um that is going to be helpful for them because that's the whole goal of doing these things, right?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, exactly. No, great answer there, Molly. Um, so let's you mentioned weight management history there. So, can you just talk me through the steps that you would take to understand kind of the weight management history of the health seeker? Is it through a survey? What are the key steps that you would that you would use? Are there any common mistakes um and any kind of protocol protocols that you would follow to collect that sort of information?
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. Yeah. So, um always uh the first thing on my mind is again kind of going through this conventional western medicine approach first of um identifying pathology.
 
 
00:39:54
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So my first concern is are there any history or active eating disorders? So either restrictive um or binging eating disorders are very common um especially in people that um kind of land in these in these spaces that we work in in um helping to optimize lifestyle factors. I've just in personal experience have seen kind of a higher pre prevalence of eating disorders than what we see in the general population. Um and so that is my first um that is is one of my my first thoughts. And then um another thought is um any medical conditions or med medications that are contributing to abnormal weight loss or weight gain. Um those are also very common um you know things that are easy to identify. You know hypothyroidism, hyperyroidism um medications um that that promote that promote weight gain. Um um certain mental health medications like antiscychotics can be you know cause a lot of weight gain for example. So, um, identifying those, um, that I would say is is a pretty common, um, mistake in that people can be started on these medications and not be given counseling about it.
 
 
00:41:07
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Some certain medications for chronic pain as well. Things like Lica or Gabapentin, for example, can cause weight gains. Those are pretty commonly prescribed medication and without appropriate counseling to to follow up and close close monitoring for that. Um and then as far as kind of the weight management history, um you know, what is what is their relationship with their weight? Um you know, family family history of these things, too. Um and looking into how they have gotten to where they are today. So, are they at their highest weight? Are they at their lowest weight? What is what was their highest or lowest weight? um depending on on what their their goals are and um what have kind of influenced these these circumstances. Um then obviously what things have been tried to lose or gain weight in the past um and what has worked, what hasn't worked um for them and uh things like relationship to food, eating preferences. Now getting into kind of like you know the nutrition pillars and lifestyle side of things.
 
 
00:42:10
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, but I would say those are kind of the most um broadstrokes categories of things I am looking into when I'm talking with someone about weight management.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Great. Thanks for that, Molly. And is it a similar process when you're looking at family history um and ethnicity and things like that? Is it the same sort of structure um in terms of a survey or interview?
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. Yep. So for family history for for blood glucose management looking for especially firstdegree relatives um with with type two diabetes or insulin resistance um that is for blood glucose management the the first thing and then um you said family history. What else did you mention?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: family history, things like ethnicity, things like that. Yeah. So, just kind of the whole encapsulation of what's your step to really get that family history information.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. Yeah. So just um Yeah. So just understanding the race ethnicity of um of the person and what the the prevalence of um higher or lower of of blood glucose management issues there.
 
 
00:43:22
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay, great. So I think we can now move on to talk about the the lifestyle medicine pillars interviews that you mentioned. Um so if we if we focus on that um can you describe kind of firstly how you the key steps that you would go through in those types of interviews and what you what you would ask um and try and understand if there are any technology or tools that you use during those interviews. Um, and then what real metrics or information do you collect from from those interviews and how do you interpret them?
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Quite questions there.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. Yeah. Uh All right. So, um do we want to stick with like the four that um that I mentioned are like highest priority in my mind for blood glucose management?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, that would be great if we stick with those four and if you can just repeat those and then we can go through them.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yep. So, um nutrition, physical activity, sleep, and stress.
 
 
00:44:21
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So with nutrition um I start by asking people you know do you have any diet dietary preferences or patterns that you follow and for for what reason? Um and then I ask um I ask people to kind of give me um a and of course allergies intolerances you know get a broad strokes of what people can or can't eat in their in their current pattern and the rationale for doing so. um there's a lot of misinformation um about you know eating and and not eating certain foods. So, I try to um if if there is um some misinformation, I try to kind of help give them some insights about that as well um at that time. And then asking, you know, give me some a rundown of of what you ate in 24 hours, you know, yesterday um uh to do a 24-hour dietary recall and really get an an idea of is this a food that they re eat on a regular basis or was that kind of an outlier. Um, and then through that 24-hour dietary recall, ask some questions about what's about their eating patterns.
 
 
00:45:29
 
Mollie Dwivedi: How many times a day are they eating? Um, is it erratic or is it pretty regular? Snacking, things like that. Um, then I also like to ask kind of just general eating habits. Do you eat out a lot? Do you cook? Um, do you buy prepared foods? Where do you get your food from? things things like that to understand if people grocery shop or do they order things online or does someone else prepare all of their food for them. Um so really getting idea of eating behaviors as well. Um and then I like to try to kind of understand um what is common for them to eat on a regular basis um throughout the day based on their 24-hour dietary recall. So um I write all this information down um because that's the the main tool that I have. And um from there we work on um kind of making swaps um and asking them what they want to work on and and going from there. But that's I don't think what you're asking with the assessment.
 
 
00:46:27
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um so technology and things like that, I will take whatever people can give me. If people want to send me a massive food log, I'll I'll review it, you know, as as best I can. um whether it's an Excel sheet, whether it's a word document, whether it's an app. Um I would welcome kind of any sort of food journaling, whatever is going to be easiest for the patient to use. Um because that's really we need to keep the end user experience in mind and their preferences and things like that. Um so I will review any sort of um of of journaling um that people do. pictures would be fine uh as well to help get a good idea. Um I have been experimenting with the Aura Stilo food logging um and CGM that's out for the Aura Labs testing right now. Um and I got to say that's that's probably one of the better food logging tools I've seen I think as as far as especially user experience. Um, so that's been great. Um, and and that I'm I've been the only one that's used I've never had a patient that's used it.
 
 
00:47:40
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um,
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Can you explain that a bit more, Molly? What what that is and the steps that you take within that? Because that's probably something we'll look into as
Mollie Dwivedi: yes.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: well.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yes. The Stilo.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yes.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yep. So, Stilo is the CGM that was is put out by Dexcom and um that m it must be kind of their non-diabetes general wellness CGM offering um and they have a partnership with Aura and how that works is the um the data from the CGM CEO CGM goes straight into your Aura app and so it shows you your blood glucose excursions integrated with all of your Aura data. So with your stress levels, with your sleep, and then also now with they have this new meal logging feature, which is new to Aura. And so it is mostly AI powered. So you can take a picture of the food that you eat and then it you can revise it um based on how accurate it is and then it will spit out um it'll spit out some information about its impression of your food logging.
 
 
00:48:54
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So that's completely like independent actually of the Stilo. You can do the meal logging without the CGM. It's right now it's an oral labs feature meaning it's like in beta testing. So it's not like a formally launch. Um but it's so they're requesting feedback. So it will give you information about um whether the meal is limited, balanced, or nutritious. Um, and then, um, if you do have the CGM, it will take that meal and it will show you your blood glucose window around the time after you ate that food to see what your personal glucose response was to that meal. Um, so I like it. I have a whole thought about CGMs in the general population and in general that's kind of a whole another side tangent could be a completely separate discussion but I think I I I don't I think they in best case should be used in conjunction with somebody who intricately understands blood glucose management and can help the person contextualize their blood glucose excursions which are completely normal right it's like a heart rate monitor your heart rate increases and decreases throughout throughout the day.
 
 
00:50:06
 
Mollie Dwivedi: It's not a It's a very physiologic phenomenon. Anyways, I like how Stilo um puts sleep and stress um and physical activity and meals all into context around blood glucose.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Thanks for that explanation. No, that was really cool. I think we might have similar thoughts on uh on CGMs to the general population um by the sounds of it. Just uh without probably going into too much detail on that, which we might do on on another call actually with CGMs, but can you just give a brief um outline of how the CGM works? Does it need to be worn all day? Is it just um is it 24 hours? Is it just worn during the daytime hours? Um just so we can collect that information. So, can you just explain what a CGM is and then how it works?
Mollie Dwivedi: Yep. Yep. So, a continuous glucose monitor is a patch that is put on your skin um on an area of fat.
 
 
00:51:01
 
Mollie Dwivedi: It's typically on um like kind of the tricep area, the back side of the arm. Um and it's a sticker with a little tiny little needle in it. And that needle goes into the interstatial fluid of the fat cells. Um so that's where it is collecting its data from. And that is important to know um because of how the the sensor works and how we interpret those values. Um but basically it is that sticker is worn for an average average of two weeks um that the sensor works and then it needs to be taken off and and replaced. Um and so the CGMs collect um this glucose information from the interstitial fluid which is not the same as the blood glucose values. So the the interstitial fluid glucose values are not the same as blood glucose. And blood glucose is what we're all very familiar with in these reference ranges and such. Um, and so these instruments are are approved for use to collect this information as long as the instrument as long as the CGM data is within 20% of the blood glucose ranges.
 
 
00:52:17
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So that's a really high, you know, discrepancy. And so people can have ab they can their their their their CGM data cannot be an accurate reflection of the glucose that is circulating in their blood which is what we care about the most. Um and so it's it's a it's they are overall pretty accurate. I don't have major concerns except for people with diabetes on insulin then I do have um concerns and we have other safeguards in place for that. But overall, um it's I I think they're pretty good um for what they're supposed to do. But it is important to know that they are not 100% accurate.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Great. Thanks for that insight. Do you have any other assessments or steps that you would take to assess that uh nutrition, lifestyle, medicine pillar? If not, let's move to to the next pillar, which might be sleep.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yep. Um the only thing I would say is um there's a tool called diet ID um out there that is a um visual dietary assessment tool that's um been validated and and is on ongoing with studies and it is um utilizing the healthy eating index.
 
 
00:53:31
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um so a very you know rigorous dietary measure measure as far as those things go. Um so it's a tool I like. I think it's convenient. I think it's quick. Um and I I I like how it works. So I think that is something that I I would like to explore some more.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Is that an AI powered tool just or is it it?
Mollie Dwivedi: I don't think so.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay. Yeah, we'll look into that in a bit more. It sounds interesting. Um,
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: okay. Great. So, should we move on to kind of the next lifestyle medicine pillar that you you investigate as part of these interviews? And then if you could do the same thing and just answer um kind of the type of assessment, any technology or tools that you use and the key steps you do go through to try and understand that lifestyle medicine pillar for that health seeker.
 
 
00:54:19
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. Yeah. So, this one should be a little bit more straightforward. Nutrition is always kind of like a crazy bag and can of worms, right? Um, so sleep. The first thing that I want to know is does this person is this person at risk for or uh do they have symptoms consistent with um a sleep disorder? So that's always kind of the first the first thing if I will look at two pieces of information to determine the need to go down any one of those rabbit holes. And the two pieces of information are how does a person subjectively report their sleep and their energy and fatigue levels during the day. And then the second piece of information that I'll look at look at is their medical history um and their vital signs anthropometric data. Are they at risk of having it regardless of what they're reporting? Um so starting with kind of the you know objective data because it's it's it's easier you know when people have an elevated um BMI and hypertension for example um I will put their kind of flagged in my mind for higher risk of sleep apnea.
 
 
00:55:23
 
Mollie Dwivedi: We we know that um especially you know men and um people with obesity and and other cardiovascular conditions um have a higher much higher prevalence of obstructed sleep apnea. Um so going down that you know realm a stop bang is the kind of easiest assessment. It's just a questionnaire um that that has calculators online. I the the app that I use for a lot of my calculations like home IR and stopbang is called MD cal. Um so it's a good free tool out there. Um so it's just um um a a questionnaire that the clinician does on behalf of the patient to stratify their risk for sleep apnea. Um so that is one tool I'll go down. Um and then depending on their subjective report of their experience with their sleep, fatigue, energy levels, um I'll consider other sleep conditions that they may have, restless leg syndrome, um you know, narcopsy, there's uh just general insomnia, um or advanced or delayed um phase sleep, um circadian rhythm disorders, things like that. So that is purely based on you know how the patient describes um any issues or symptoms that they may be having.
 
 
00:56:45
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um if people have um you know anemia for example they're um at higher risk of restless leg syndrome things like that. Um so the subjective kind of discussion with the patient about their sleep um really determines next steps. So from there you can do if if the patient is reporting symptoms of insomnia, you can do an insomnia um um well let me let me back up for a second actually. I like the GSAQ um general sleep assessment questionnaire whichever I have it in our cascade lifestyle sleep assessment because that is a broad screening tool that looks for many different types of sleep disorders. So, it's it intended to be a screening tool like in the primary care setting to just like see if people have um are flagging for any of these things. Um so, I like that one. But then, um there's also like the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index um questionnaire, but you can use different questionnaires depending on symptoms that a person is endorsing. I think like the insomnia severity index is an important one for people that are reporting symptoms of insomnia.
 
 
00:57:56
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, so we'll kind of go down those rabbit holes based on these subjective reports.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay, great. So, for for those um assessments, how do you how do you interpret them? Is it a discussion that you have with the health seeker? Is there a good or a poor kind of threshold or any norms or reference ranges again? And how confident are you in those assessments in terms of yeah, their validity, reliability, sensitivity, and specity if you can be with those types of assessments?
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. So, um you know, it's it's like um it's it's like anything. Um I I will say the stop bang I have um pretty high confidence in. um just because sleep apnea is very very prevalent um and very underdiagnosed. So I have found more often than not when I set somebody for a sleep study based on a positive or a higher risk stop bang that they then do have sleep apnea. I have pretty high confidence in stopping. Um, and the other questionnaires, um, I would say the GSAQ, you know, the more general you go with these questionnaires, the probably the lower the sensitivity and specificity is, but, um, it's better than nothing.
 
 
00:59:21
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So, that's how I um, it is it is a validated questionnaire. Um, it's certainly not perfect, but it does have, I think, relatively I think it has appropriate um, and enough to justify use like the GSAQ. Um now as you go more specific um like the ISI is the idea is is to look for the severity of the insomnia. Um and so that becomes you know a little bit more narrow and um has you know I think very good um sensitivity and specificity. So I I think I have generally more confidence in those more specific questionnaires um once we're kind of narrowing down what the pathology is. But they're just they function as different things. the GSAQ is more of like a screening tool um where the ISI is is more of kind of um help with understanding severity of diagnosis. Um that being said um I um when people have very severe sleep pathology that is really impairing their their their sleep functioning, I I I have a low threshold to refer out because most of those patients need a sleep study.
 
 
01:00:28
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um so um yeah so rarely will I make a diagnosis based on questionnaires alone um unless the patient has minimal or no other risk factors or features that could suggest other things and um I think a sleep study is a a good idea or referral to to sleep medicine for for that reason. Um, and then the other thing that I didn't mention is, you know, the other just kind of subjective questioning that I ask about people's sleep. So, I like to ask about the quality of their sleep. Do they do they wake up um feeling well well rested? Um, and the quantity of the sleep. How many hours are they sleeping on a regular basis, weekdays, weekends? Um, and uh how regular they are about their sleep schedule. Are they going to bed at the the same time? Waking up around the the same time. Um, and what time are they going to bed? Um, again, looking at these circadian rhythm disorders, advanced or delayed um phase are are pretty common.
 
 
01:01:29
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, so looking at looking at all those all of those things, are they waking up in the middle of the night? Um, just doing kind of a a subjective inventory of all of those things to help guide um understanding of what's going on as well. Then especially in like elderly populations, looking at things like medication um and um timing of of liquids and all that kind of stuff can influence how people sleep as well.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay, great. Lots of information there. And you mentioned a sleep study. Would that be classed as um an intervention assessment based off of the initial assessment that you do? So, just trying to clarify where that sits in our ontology. If if you um if the health seekers will do those questionnaires and you think they might then need a sleep study, that then might be classed as an intervention. Would that sit does that make sense in in kind of your process?
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, so I I would think of it as a secondary assessment in that it would be something that somebody does a questionnaire maybe I meet with them, pull out a bunch more information and then I think it would be ordered at that time.
 
 
01:02:42
 
Mollie Dwivedi: A sleep study would be something that requires um requires a discussion and inventory uh beforehand.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay, great. Thanks for that clarification. Okay. Um, if that's all of the assessments on sleep, should we move to the next lifestyle medicine pillar which I think you mentioned was stress.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yep. And then I'll also add um wearables of course. Um
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yes.
Mollie Dwivedi: so wearables um are I think helpful in the only thing I use them for is understanding the hours. Um I I shouldn't say that I I use them primarily to understand more precisely how many hours people are sleeping and to help them drive awareness of the number of hours that they are sleeping to help kind of as a self-monitoring tool really more than anything. Um I Aura Ring has um slightly I think useful data about um stages of sleep though that is something um I would rarely look at in in isolation um absent you know other um symptoms and things going on with their sleep but
 
 
01:03:55
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Great.
Mollie Dwivedi: stress
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, just to clarify those those last wearables is related to sleep assessments for the
Mollie Dwivedi: What?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: benefit of the transcript. Um, okay, cool. Let's go on to let's go on to stress. So yeah, if you can talk me through the type of assessments again, the steps that you would take, what you would collect in terms of metrics and um how you feel about the confidence you have in that test related to you know the usual reliability, validity, specificity and and um specivity and forgotten the other one, but go for it.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. Yeah. Um so for stress um I try to um thanks Karen. Um I try to um zoom out a little bit and my first priority in discussing stress is understanding actually the mental health of the patients. This is where I kind of go into like the other pillar um because I want to be sure that something that we are considering to be stress isn't actually have um kind of origins or um you know or relating to things especially like anxiety um and stress can often be um confused.
 
 
01:05:07
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So that is my first priority. And you know, the tools I like to look at um for mental health are going to be things like a GAD 7 um or a PHQ9. Um and also, you know, in an ideal world, I I would love if we if we have the the resources and the support to address them would be a history of trauma. Now, that's something that we don't want to dive into lightly and without, you know, significant resources to attend to that. Um but that if if I were to be you know complete in in my assessment it would be um that and then talking about symptoms any present symptoms that they have. Um history is really important here. So personal history um and family history is is also very important. Then we kind of like dabble into reach into substance use as well. You know that is often related. So we're kind of you know going down another path here. Those are my first priorities to make sure we don't have um any significant disturbances there because those have very different interventions.
 
 
01:06:11
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um but if we let's say all of the screening um is negative for mood disorders, I don't have any concern for for mood disorders, then really looking at at stress. And so how I think about stress is um the demands on somebody and then somebody's resources to manage their demands. That is really what is what defines somebody experiencing stress is if they're they people are stressed if they're the demands on them exceed their resources. And so, um, unfortunately, sensitivity, specificity of these instruments and capturing this data is probably the worst of anything that we've we've talked about, right? Um, so I really actually don't know um the sensitivity or spec specificity of the PSS4 um other than it is a validated instrument. Um but I think stress is is a very um subjective uh topic and that can be very difficult to manage. That being said, I do think that um it is you can get a lot of in of information about stress by this um interview and discussion with the patient. Um do they feel that they have a a lot of demands on them relative their to their ability to attend or manage their demands?
 
 
01:07:36
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, so I would say most of my um, discussions around stress kind of um, relate to that. Um, how just they subjectively feel on a day-to-day basis. Um, I like the PSS4 because you can trend it over time and um, you can get an an idea and it can help people develop some awareness of their stress. Um, then the other piece of the assessment is how do they manage stress? How have they historically managed stress? Do they feel that they're successful? um what is it that helps them um manage their stress when they when they do feel really stressed and exploring those those techniques is um I think a great part of that. Um Aura Ring does give that stress um indicator which um I have no idea the metrics that they use to to pull that up but I do think it's very interesting and I think it's helpful. Um, I would say I have, you know, minimal, I would say low. I would say I have low confidence in like the Aura Ring stress metric.
 
 
01:08:37
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, but I I do think that it can be a helpful um self uh self-monitoring tool um for people to develop some insight and awareness about their thoughts, feelings, emotions, mental health, and how it actually physiologically impacts their body.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: That's great. Are there any other wearables that you kind of consider in terms of their stress metrics or is it it mainly just aura that you've looked at or you you kind of have experience in
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah, Aura is the only one that has really I mean Apple Watch gives you some mindfulness reminders. Um, and I don't know where that has where where how those are populated. Um, if they monitor anything that triggers a mindfulness reminder um or if that's completely random. Um but yeah, or is the only one
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay, great. Thanks for that. So, I think do we have one more lifestyle medicine pillar to discuss out of the four? I can't remember if we've been through three or four at this point.
Mollie Dwivedi: physical activity
 
 
01:09:40
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, that is a key one. Yes, physical activity. Um, yeah, we've got we've got a bit more time. Um, we'll push into like our debrief time. If we can just finish off talking about physical activity as an assessment, I think that'll be a good a good uh finish point for us today. So yeah, Molly, if you can talk us through how you assess the physical activity pillar again with the same questions around um what technology tools you use, the key steps that you would take, um the metrics you collect and reliability, validity, sensitivity and specivity. See?
Mollie Dwivedi: Yes. Yes. Um, okay. So, this is a this is obviously a huge bucket of words that I'll try to be as succinct as I can. Um, so I always start um well I have I built in the IPAC into our um into our questionnaire that's been shown to be a a pretty good um a pretty reliable validated you know questionnaire for understanding people's physical activity and this is you know probably more in in your realm um than mine actually.
 
 
01:10:42
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um so I think it's I think it's pretty good um in in terms of understanding where people are at and the idea the reference range that I am using is the physical activity guidelines for Americans. So 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity physical activity 75 minutes of vigorous int intensity two days of strength training all major muscle groups. that is the target that I'm trying to move most people to because most people are falling far behind that. Now, um a part of my counseling is also encouraging beyond that if people reach that. But really that is kind of my benchmark reference range that I use for most people and when I'm trying to either through the IPAC or discussion with them understand where they are falling on that spectrum of minutes and days per week um that they are um getting that physical activity and then um I would say that's the really the biggest thing and then the other thing is is is is understanding understanding because people don't tell you that they're doing 80 minutes of moderate intensity.
 
 
01:11:52
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um understanding whether it's light, moderate or vigorous intensity um through mostly discussion is is kind of what I've um with my historical practice been able to do. Um but also then we can tie in wearables here to understand and more accurately categorize um moderate light moderate v vigorous intensity physical activity. Um and so I'd say the confidence certainly goes up as we you know use the wearables because I think those are very good indicators of of where people are falling. Um and um yeah, I mean I would say to be succinct that's probably um that's that's probably Yes.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, that's great. And we can follow up and go into more detail on on this as well. Um, but just finally just around kind of that physical activity pillar, is there any consideration of the health's current state when you interpret what they say in terms of how much activity they do during the week and the intensity of that activity?
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. So, um yeah, certainly. So one of the things that I try to understand well okay and then I mean there's also steps.
 
 
01:13:19
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So there's a lot more data as time is going on showing how much um physical activity distinct from exercise um influences health outcomes and so even things like steps we know also correlate to improved health outcomes. So if I ideally would be able to collect all of this data, you know, steps, daily steps and then uh minutes of moderate to vigorous and strength training. Um I would collect all of that information ideally. Um and so I I do think a lot about um I I I I separate physical activity from exercise um in my assessment. So understanding how some how active and functional somebody is in their day and their job. Are they doing yard work? Are they doing gardening? Do they, you know, work on airplanes? Um as opposed to somebody who's, you know, sitting at a desk or not moving from the couch all day. Um so I do certainly kind of distinguish that. um as far as somebody's baseline state of course I you know take into consideration but more so I am trying to understand whether what they are doing is moderate or vigorous um based on RP versus talk test um which they're in which their baseline state influences that right what's moderate for somebody may not be moderate for another person so I think I assess that more most formally Um, given kind of the limited tools of of of

Mollie Dwivedi: my practice through discussion with the patient and how vigorous their perceived exercise is.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay, great. Thanks for that, Molly. So, just in the interest of time, I think we'll we'll put a stop on the interview here and we'll follow up. I think a part two will just be an immediate follow-up on the interventions that you would do based off of the insulin resistance coming out of those assessments as well. So, we'll we'll go into that in a bit more detail.
