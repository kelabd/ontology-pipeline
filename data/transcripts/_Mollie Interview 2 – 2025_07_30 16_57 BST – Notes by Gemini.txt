Mollie Dwivedi: room because my neighbors have construction going on.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: No worries. If you need to go do that, feel free. Or if you need to pause at any point, that's fine as well.
Mollie Dwivedi: Okay, sounds like he's calmed down for a minute. So, I'll just hope he's stays that way.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Which dog have you got?
Mollie Dwivedi: Uh, he's a Dalmatian.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Oh, cute. Okay. You'll have he'll have to make an appearance on one of these calls, Molly.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yes, he is um he is a highmaintenance guy. He's our protector. So, he he infuses us to some drama into protecting the house.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: I love that.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Wow. Okay. Right. So let's get started with carrying on from part one um where we were talking about insulin sensitivity, insulin resistance and a number of assessments you discussed. So I'll just re go through those assessments and then just confirm that they are the correct ones and then we can go through into the interventions.
 
 
00:01:08
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: So I believe the assessments that we spoke about last week were um fast in blood glucose, hemoglobin A1C, fasting insulin. So there are the the blood markers or the blood tests. Um there was body composition as well. So BMI, DAX, um anthropometric data, um family history, weight history, I think lifestyle medicine pillars as well in terms of that lifestyle medicine. um consultation overview um and you went through each of those in in detail. So if we can go through probably in the similar sort of order um the interventions for those assessments. So if we start with the blood work um so fasting blood glucose uh hemoglobin A1C fasting insulin so the first question for the interventions will be how do you design interventions from those assessment results? So how do the results of those blood tests inform your intervention choice?
Mollie Dwivedi: Mhm. Yeah. So I think the f the the the first thing that I'll say is that um with with any patient with any patient I think of their lifestyle pillars as opportunities for intervention regardless of their presence of a disease state because we know that people can be, you know, 27, 32, you know, 39 and have very poor lifestyle habits in multiple domains or maybe even just one or two domains and um they I shouldn't use the word domain because that's a ontology term in one or two pillars.
 
 
00:03:15
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um and then and show no signs of disease. their insulin. They may have no, you know, obvious signs of insulin resistance. Um, they may be a normal body weight, but we do know that if continued, they will be predisposed to developing insulin resistance in any of these conditions. So, the first thing that I'll say kind of I I start at the foundational level. um what are high-risk behaviors that if continued will likely lead to metabolic dysfunction in in this in this kind of um sphere that we're talking about right now. So that includes all all of the six pillars of lifestyle medicine and then also you know considering weight management and mental health. Um so that's the first kind of thing that I'm thinking about with assessment and intervention. I want to intervene on any of those things. Um that you know this is kind of gets into the coach approach and that's I think a separate conversation of how to think about intervening with lifestyle intervention. Um and working on whatever the patient wants to work on at that point.
 
 
00:04:24
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So that's foundational and regardless of any sort of specific testing. Then the second layer that I'm thinking about is okay, what am I learning about their body composition, um their weight management, um their family history, um and their medical history, um what what am I learning about them that may increase our risk of developing insulin resistance? So for example um elevated visceral atapost tissue or elevated waist circumference I'm looking at those types of assessments if we call them but those are probably metrics I think in in your world um but looking at those and discussing if those are predisposing to insulin resistance so overweight for example um or let's say elevated waist circumference because that's more a little bit more um specific um talking about how the presence of that excess vis visceral atapost tissue predisposes to insulin resistance. So I'm thinking about all of those things and I'm intervening at every single one of these layers regardless of their lab values because the lab values is means when we're start we're starting to get into trouble. Um whereas we're talking more preventive stuff if we're just considering no disease with you know elevated waist circumference and abnormal kind of lifestyle pillars or suboptimal lifestyle pillars.
 
 
00:05:54
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So I'm thinking about intervening at every one of these steps on behalf of preventing insulin resistance if it's not already there. Um so that is kind of the framework that I take to this which is more of our kind of lifestyle medicine framework. Um, and then kind of getting into the conventional um, approach is when we're thinking about assessing the the DEXA um, and the blood work and all of those things and intervening. So I think is that probably where you want to spend most of the time is like interpreting the visceral atapost tissue like intervening on the blood work. Is that kind of where you want to focus, right?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: I'm happy to focus on all of it if you've got the time. So, we could start with the lifestyle medicine pillars because I think that's a really interesting um point because we are focusing on preventative kind of medicine here as well, aren't we? So, um in terms of those lifestyle medicine pillars, we can we can go into detail um for those. So, what would be your kind of process for for that?
 
 
00:07:11
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: So, how do you structure um any interventions within those pillars? And um are there any kind of specific protocols you have in terms of standardized protocols or templates for interventions within those pillars? Um and progression plans. So, just detail around those within those pillars would be a good start, I think.
Mollie Dwivedi: Okay. Okay. Yeah. So, um we talked about last time with like assessing sleep for example, we want to start to understand if there is any pathology that needs further assessment and treatment. So that's that was on the assessment side. Now we're thinking about treatment um of of sleep problems. So again the first layer is we treat any problem that is any sort of um medical condition sleep problem um that that is there. So restless leg syndrome, um insomnia, we can I can go down another kind of rabbit hole with that one, but um restless leg syndrome, sleep apnea, things like that or organic sleep disorders that need specific types of treatment. So that is first and foremost the um consideration ruling out andor treating those conditions.
 
 
00:08:30
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, with insomnia specifically, we know that the best treatment for insomnia is actually largely lifestyle driven with using a protocol called cognitive behavior, cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. We know that that is the first line and most effective treatment for for insomnia. Um it is called CBTI and it is a um standardized intervention um that is delivered by certified practitioners. Um and so so that's one that kind of you know it's a it it's kind of an organic sleep disorder but it requires a lot of lifestyle focused treatment. Um, but then for every single person who has or doesn't have a sleep disorder, I'm thinking about primarily their sleep duration and quality. Um, and I I want I want most adults to be sleeping 7 to n hours on average every night. Um, older adults require a little bit less sleep. Um, so looking at more like 7 to eight hours per night. Uh, but I really want to assess whether or not people are are getting that amount of sleep. So, if they aren't getting that, if they're not getting adequate sleep and they're kind of going into chronic sleep deprivation with six or less hours of sleep every night, um, then we want to do some interventions to assess why that may be.
 
 
00:10:03
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Again, that's not considering that we've ruled out other causes that may cause short sleep duration. Um but this is where sleep hygiene comes in and this is where a lot of um lifestyle medicine in the sleep realm kind of plays into things and the studies have shown that sleep hygiene inter interventions can be effective in increasing the duration of sleep. Um, so I like to just kind of phrase this in a way of of telling patients, I want to make sure that we are not getting in our own way of getting enough sleep every night. That's kind of the goal. Your body may or may not sleep when you want it to, but we want to make sure that we're not doing things that get in the way of you getting adequate sleep that helps you feel rested and that decreases your risk of um of cardiumabolic conditions. So um the interventions for sleep um largely kind of actually borrow from CBTI principles um and we want to focus on uh what is the person's natural rhythm? When do they when do they normally fall asleep and wake up in the morning um setting in setting an an early wake time can be a helpful way um for people that really kind of struggle to keep themselves up at night and things like that.
 
 
00:11:26
 
Mollie Dwivedi: There's a whole um there's a whole kind of toolbox of of interventions that come from mostly CBTI, but it's focusing on sleep hygiene. Um decreasing um blue light exposure primarily through uh phone, tablet, computer screens. TV seems to be less impactful actually um in that realm. And uh of course paying attention to um things like caffeine and you know how late or are people drinking caffeine or how late are they drinking caffeine. Um things like that and also uh bed restriction um which is where we have people get out of bed if they are tossing and turning or laying in bed for a long time. So these are all I I'll put them under the umbrella of slight sleep hygiene interventions that require a detailed interview. So the the the intervention is a detailed interview about people's sleep habits. So starting from when they wake up in the morning until when they go to sleep at night and what happens in the middle of the night until they wake up again the next morning. I kind of want to know everything.
 
 
00:12:32
 
Mollie Dwivedi: When are they napping? Are they napping? Are they taking stimulants? Um all of these things. So the intervention is a detailed interview and then setting a couple of um high target or high value interventions um to improve their sleep hygiene. And this can be very effective for for people um very personalized. That is kind of um how I approach sleep hygiene interventions is through discussion tailored um tailored treatment uh that is mostly reliant upon CBTI principles that can also involve like a sleep log that is part of the traditional CBTI program. Um I don't do that with with everybody but it is part of the established CBTI um program. So that um about and and the other thing of course that plays into this is discussion of um sedative medications. So often times people who've had long-standing um sleep disorders uh our our goal is to get people off of the medications because they don't they seem to have a lot of adverse effects for for for long-term health and we know that it people don't get the restful active sleep that they get with a normal sleep cycle.
 
 
00:13:56
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um it just kind of makes them not awake. Um, so that's a long-term thing. Um, and definitely this is not something that is adjusted right from the the get-go, but people can really see really good improvements in their sleep and how they're feeling um with these with these lifestyle interventions. Um, okay, so that's sleep. Um, yeah.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Is there a a follow-up timeline on those interventions, Molly? So, when you first have the the interview with them, what's the timeline when you kind of check in with them on has their sleep changed, for example?
Mollie Dwivedi: So, I like to follow people pretty closely. Um, because this is this can be distressing for people because they can be tired for a few days. So that's also, you know, without kind of going into like the full details of what my like complete structured sleep assessment is, which I'm happy to do, um, and and completely kind of like outline top to bottom, but you know, I explained to them that this you you may be tired.
 
 
00:15:04
 
Mollie Dwivedi: We're going to be waking you up early and keeping you up as late as you can stay awake with the hopes of resetting your circadian rhythm over time, but that results in some fatigue and that can be really stressful for patients to take on. And so I like to follow them very closely to know that we so that they know that this is an experiment and we're going to adjust and tailor as time goes on. So I follow up with people usually every two weeks at the most if we're really kind of working intensely on this as long as they're committed to it. If people are like if give me the steps I can kind of do it on my own then I can follow them you know once a month. But I would say for the people that struggle the most they typically want closer followup. So two to four weeks to short answer.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: That's great. Thanks for that. I think what we'll probably do is deep dive on sleep intervention on a on another call as well.
 
 
00:15:58
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: But um yeah, if we can circle back to the next intervention as part of this call, that would be great.
Mollie Dwivedi: Mhm. Yeah. So nutrition would that be fair place to start? Okay. This is one that I I also I think is is actually probably the most impactful um when we're intervention when we're thinking about insulin resistance. Um so we I mentioned last time that I do kind of a dietary 24-hour dietary recall and um understanding what people are eating and try to give them some swaps or ideas of ways that they can improve their diet. Um, I also like the I mentioned also the diet ID um that that uh leans on the uh healthy eating index. Um so as far as nutrition interventions go um the first the couple of things that I'm thinking about are number one well what are what are they eating? So, are we eating a lot of refined grains? Are we eating a lot of animal products? Are we eating a lot of ultrarocessed foods?
 
 
00:17:18
 
Mollie Dwivedi: And thinking about about kind of the the substance of what they're eating on a on a day-to-day basis. The other thing I'm thinking about is what are their eating bea behaviors? Are they eating one meal a day and maybe snacking or just just one meal? Are they eating out um you know four times a week kind of thing? Um do they cook? Um does their partner cook? Are they in control of of what they're eating at all? Um and so mostly with a focus mostly mostly with a focus on um what you're eating because a lot of times people can't change so much their circumstances of how they're getting their food and how it's being prepared for them. And specifically with um so in with thinking about insulin resistance um one of the things that I'm really thinking about a lot is these refined grains and saturated fat. So refined grains and sugar sweetened beverages are super easy lowhanging fruit and we know that they contribute to insulin resistance and all cardioabolic conditions.
 
 
00:18:33
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So refined grains are going to be things like, you know, pizza, crackers, cookies, chips, um you know, anything a lot of things that come in like boxes and bags, for example. So those foods are really um concentrated in terms of calories. So the calorie density of these foods is very high relative to other foods, primarily um plant whole plant foods. And so start with a with anything that has added sugar and and refined grains and try to minimize or eliminate those. And I use kind of um I I really like the red yellow green light framework. Yellow red I'm sorry green light meaning eat these foods add lib. I'm not really worried about how much you're eating these foods and enjoy them without thinking so much about your portions. yellow light foods, meaning let's really moderate um portions of these. These are not something that you want to make up more than like 25% of what you're eating at a time. And then red light being things that we really want to avoid as as much as possible.
 
 
00:19:40
 
Mollie Dwivedi: A lot of ultrarocessed foods and refined grains, pastries, things like that are going to fall in in red light foods. These are not things that we want to buy and bring into the house. Um, and then yellow light foods, that's going to be the sugar sweetened beverages, things with added sugar, things like that, the things that people generally know that they shouldn't be eating, right? Um, and then the yellow light foods are going to be things um I my approach is to put um lowfat dairy in this in this category. I put highfat dairy more in like a red light category. That's my personal approach kind of supported by the healthy eating index or the alternative healthy eating index for example. Um and so I put highfat dairy which is really most most dairy in kind of a red light um category and then lowfat dairy in the yellow light category. And things other things that I put in there are going to be poultry, eggs um and yeah poultry and eggs basically. The other thing I didn't mention that I put in the red light category is going to be red meat.
 
 
00:20:48
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um so beef, um lamb, ve things like that. Also, uh processed meats, bacon, um um uh deli meats, hot dogs, broughtwur, things like that. All those things have been associated, red meat and processed meat with increased risk of uh of cancers, specifically colon cancer. Really strong associations there. And then also um with heart disease as well. pretty strong really strong associations. So, um those are why those are in the red light and then the yellow light I put um eggs and poultry in there because in high proportions they have been shown to be associated with insulin resistance um and cardiovascular disease as well. The associations are a lot less strong that is for sure. Um, but the reason I don't have them in that green light category is because of those associations and also they lack the beneficial compounds that we see with a lot of whole plant foods that are actually decreasing our risk of cancer and things like that. So the green light foods are going to be whole plant foods.
 
 
00:21:53
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, peas, lentils, nuts and seeds, herbs and spices. And then also uh fatty fish. So like salmon and things like that that have been shown to have some you know a lot of um cardio protective benefits. Um so those are the things that I have in the the green light category. So that's the framework I like to use with patients and um the reason those foods are all in the green light is because they vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, antioxidants you know abound and the high fiber content of these foods which you know increasing fiber intake is associated with decreased all cause mortality and um decreased cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, all of these things, cancers, you name it. Um and so lots of of of disease fighting compounds in those foods and they don't lack they lack the properties that increase our risk for for diet for for chronic diseases. So that is why I use that framework and um that is how I'm thinking of refined grains, sugar sweetened beverages. Um and then also you know eating a highfat diet can in increases the calories that you're eating throughout the day which increases to the development increases the development of insulin resistance and other chronic conditions.
 
 
00:23:17
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So that's why I'm I'm thinking about those things and increasing our fiber intake. So my interventions for people are around maximizing our green light foods and having those be at least 75% of somebody's meal at a given time. So that's what I try to tell them is we want to crowd out the other foods by maximizing our green light foods. And then we want, you know, 25% or less of the plate to be yellow or red like foods, preferably obviously more um yellow than red. And um that is a framework and it's it's hard to kind of discuss nutrition interventions largely because everybody is so different and there are so many considerations of kind of where you start with any given person um based on cultural preferences, taste preferences, availability. But that is the framework that I apply um to everybody really. there are very few people who I don't recommend that approach for. Um, and the the people who we need to work a little bit more closely with and and and not necessarily apply that framework to are people that have GI conditions that um prevent them from eating high amounts of fiber comfortably.
 
 
00:24:46
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, that's kind of the main exclusion. Um I I would I would consider I'd have to think about that a little bit more but but for vast majority of people that is a really good framework. Um and we can see actually that diabetes type 2 diabetes we can we can put pre-diabetes and diabetes into remission with lifestyle intervention and primarily nutrition and physical activity are going to be kind of the most important. So that is a really important counseling piece that I tell people as a part of the intervention right from the get-go. I am we are using this these interventions as medicine for you because we know that they're actually more effective at reversing I I don't like I don't like the word reverse but um in some cases like pre-diabetes we can pretty comfortably reverse it um with ongoing and sustained dietary changes. So I I tell them that this is this is like our medicine and it's just as effective if not more effective than certain medications. Um and then is is that helpful in terms of nutrition intervention or is that too broad?
 
 
00:26:04
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: No, that's good. I think I've I've got a few follow-up questions on there. And you mentioned what I thought was good there. You mentioned a number of different constructs that it links to as well. Um, which is going to be useful for building our our map out. Um, so just with the So you you've described kind of your framework there with the red um and the green lights. Um so just a follow up on that is what's the kind of resource level requirement in terms of staff expertise um and practical burden for that just so we can note that down but then also um what are the reassessment intervals on that? So if you have that discussion with the the house seeker when do you next come back to review what they've done and how do you what they've changed and how do you do that
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. So the resources um required you think you mean for um for kind of determining somebody's diet.
 
 
00:27:05
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: yeah for determining their diet and the if the framework is kind of standard for everyone. And I know you mentioned there are some um specifics if people have kind of GI problems and things like that, but generally when a health seeker comes and you're going to give them a nutrition intervention, do you have that framework set generally for everyone or does it take a little bit of time to with some nuance of adjusting that for that specific health seeker? So just interested on how long that takes so we can kind of factor that in.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. So, um yeah. So, I um so um I my interventions are are conversational in nature. That's because I have not had the luxury of for many different reasons of tools to help facilitate this. Um, and the so I'm trying to think of kind of like an ideal an ideal pathway treatment pathway that isn't so divergent from what I'm doing right now because that's I need to use that as a frame of reference.
 
 
00:28:23
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, so as far as I what I like about what I like about Diet ID is that it does it it it's a it's a um it's a tool where people log on and you say, "Okay, I eat a keto diet or I eat a vegan diet." Um, and then it'll say, "Do you eat a traditional western vegan diet or do you eat like a South um Asian diet or do you, you know, like what what and asks a little bit about um a little bit about kind of general food preferences and then you go through and you click on whichever and I I have a um a free assessment tool. If you ever want to use it, just let me know. um you click on which food picture looks more like what you eat and based on that it gives the clinician a report of okay this person of their of their likely um food profile. I found it to be pretty accurate for myself. I haven't used it with a lot of people, but I like that um because as opposed to sending photos of your food or putting it into chronometer or My Fitness Pal, um it gives you a better estimate of what people are eating regularly day after day as opposed to like what did they eat on Saturday versus what did they eat on Tuesday, which may not be super representative of their general patterns.
 
 
00:29:53
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So, I like that because it's very fast. I mean, you can do the whole thing in like 2 minutes and I think it's more generalizable to their life. Um, so that's to say I like that tool and that plus kind of conversations with people with just a 24-hour dietary recall. Um, I think I think is a good way to frame the intervention and pick out specific targets that we're going to work on. So, my intervention looks like reviewing assessment data, whatever that may be. Maybe diet AD and a 24-hour dietary recall or some sort of food log. Um, whatever we we we can use. Um, some sort of food log review. And then discussion about our general goals, maximizing whole plant foods, minimizing or considering eliminating red light foods. Right? That's kind of the intervention discussing that and education, right? Education's key. People have a lot of questions um about, you know, what about soy milk? What about, you know, tofu? What all these kinds kinds of things.
 
 
00:31:01
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um and then structuring a plan for them. And how I like to deliver the plan is to give them a couple of things to work on, follow up in two to four weeks, depending on how dedicated or invested they are in this process, what else they have going on. Um, if people want to get right on it and make a lot of changes, two weeks is good. If people are like, I have a lot going on. I'm going to work on this for a month. Let's re come back. Again, kind of just patient preference there. um and report how that went. And from I find that to be kind of the best way to do this because my goal is for these interventions to be completely sustainable for the rest of their life. I don't want to give them a meal plan that they're going to stick on the refrigerator and eat for 4 days and then, you know, do it once a week thereafter. I want to teach them how to pick better things in the grocery store and in the in the restaurant.
 
 
00:32:04
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, now I think as far as intervention tools, I think there's a lot that can be explored and should be explored. Um, things that are potentially involve during the intervention sending sending photos and making a note. I got this instead of fried chicken. um and engagement, ongoing live engagement almost or async but with um with a dietitian um and or a health coach. I think health coaches can deliver these interventions. Um as as long as we're kind of establish a framework of what we want the health coach to to work off of. Um Tram is amazing because she's a health coach and a dietitian. So, you know, she really doesn't, you know, need a whole lot of like um, you know, input about what people should be eating because she's a dietitian. So, she can guide that. Um, and so that is would be my desired intervention if I were to have any tools um, available. Does that answer your question? I don't know if that specifically answered your two questions, but
 
 
00:33:14
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: I think I think you gave a lot of context there which is which is really useful and and what I'm hearing kind of within what you're saying as well is habits and behavior change is important too. Um which I think will be another discussion. So um hesitant to go into that into too much detail kind of today. I think we could dedicate a whole call to that. Um but that's definitely it sounds like that with it with these types of interventions we need to have kind of habits and behavior change coming alongside that as well. Um okay. So should we move on to the next uh lifestyle medicine intervention which I think physical activity. Um and we go for your recommendations for for that.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. Yep. So, um, Yep. So, so for physical activity, um, again, the assessment framework that I'm looking at is minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity, um, and resistance training and balance training for for older adults. Um, and that, you know, comes from from the IPAC, um, to or or can come from the IPAC.
 
 
00:34:26
 
Mollie Dwivedi: I like the IPAC for that with a strength training question added on to that to understand how physically active people are. um in relation to those guidelines. And so the intervention is to increase that those minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity um and resistance training and balance training if needed. Um and the reason for that is because trials like the with kind of honing back to the um honing back to the insulin resistance pathway here. um the diabetes prevention program showed us that that level of of physical activity and above can reverse pre-diabetes or put it into remission um very effectively um alongside nutrition intervention. So that's kind of what we're we're targeting um and and aiming to increase. Um so and actually can I put a pin in this? I realized that I didn't tie the nutrition intervention back to insulin resistance.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: That's fine. Yeah, let's go back to the nutrition intervention.
Mollie Dwivedi: I just realized that I was like, as I said this, I didn't even connect this to I got so far down this rabbit hole.
 
 
00:35:40
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, okay.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: No, that's my fault as well.
Mollie Dwivedi: So, okay.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: I should have brought I should have brought you back. So, um we'll we'll just edit that bit out of the transcript.
Mollie Dwivedi: Okay. So, so, so the a a spotlight on nutrition intervention for insulin resistance for people who have insulin resistance or at risk of de developing it. Um, and that is we we do want to reduce the intake of saturated fat and we want to decrease calories. That is really important because the underlying I just this is something that that's really important to for um I think a lot of people to understand because of how many people this affects. Um the issue with insulin resistance is that we have fat and tissues that should not have fat. So that is primarily the liver and skeletal muscle. Those are kind of the the biggest kind of organs that are affected by this. And what happens is these tissues take up fat because the fat needs to go somewhere in the body and we've exceeded like the subcutaneous stores that are not as problematic.
 
 
00:36:54
 
Mollie Dwivedi: And so these tissues start to accumulate fat. And when they have fat, of course, they're dysfunctional. And so they don't respond to insulin signaling well. And so that is when the insulin starts to kind of bounce off the cells and it's not opening the door of the cells to allow the cells to take up the glucose. You can kind of think of it as a lock and key model. The the key the the keyhole is is gummed up from from the fat and it's not opening the door to allow the glucose out of the blood circulation and into these tissues for appropriate processing. So when that insulin isn't o isn't opening the door then we have accumulation of insulin and blood glucose in in the blood and so the pancreas starts to dump out more and more insulin to try to overcome this barrier to get the the the glucose out of the bloodstream and as a result that's why we have the high blood sugar. So with dietary interventions, the goal is to get the fat out of these tissues.
 
 
00:37:59
 
Mollie Dwivedi: We want to remove the fat from the liver and skeletal muscle primarily and we do that through weight loss. Lot of different ways that you can lose weight and lots of different dietary interventions that that that can can be effective for weight loss and blood sugar control. When we're thinking about blood sugar control, a lot of people will say, "Well, low carbohydrates improve blood sugar control." Which is true. It It is not untrue. And in in short-term studies that they have been shown to be effective, but what we're doing is we are just shutting off the faucet of a clogged sink. We're not unclogging the sink. So now I'm using a different analogy from a lock and key to a a plugged sync. But the low carbohydrate diets just shut that off. And it also does not address the other comorbid conditions that often exist with insulin resistance. So high cholesterol, increased risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, metabolic syndrome. A low carb diet actually can make those things worse. And so we're not just treating the blood sugar number for people.
 
 
00:39:13
 
Mollie Dwivedi: That is is not in my opinion should not be our goal because people are a host of all of these different potential conditions and I want to treat their blood sugar, but I also don't want to skyrocket their cholesterol um and increase their their blood pressure. And so the low carbohydrate diets often tend to be higher in animal protein which we do know can result in increased um blood lipids and we are seeing some evidence that it can actually increase um plaque in the in the coronary arteries as well. Some really kind of early studies there and so we want to be really mindful of that. So, this is where going to our green light whole plant foods is really the most effective and sustainable intervention for addressing addressing insulin resistance because those foods have a really low calorie density. So, per pound of food, the green light the green light foods have a lot fewer calories than any of the yellow and red light foods. And this is specifically where we're talking about kind of, you know, getting away um from high amounts of of poultry and eggs and going more towards plant proteins, beans, peas, lentils, things like that.
 
 
00:40:33
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um because they are they do have lower calories and higher fiber relative to the eggs and poultry. And so through the low calories, we're managing our weight easier, which is allowing us to potentially lose weight, pull fat out of those tissues in a way that does not increase our risk of eating too many calories and having high amounts of saturated fat, which are not good for our other cardioabolic conditions. Um, so that is really key. That is the the CA concept of calorie density um is key for addressing insulin resistance because the goal is weight loss and eating high amounts of whole plant foods allow people to feel satiated when they're eating. It is a good long-term um strategy. So that is why um I really focus on on um increasing those whole plant foods for um reducing insulin resistance and also reducing their risk of their of the very commonly comorbid conditions um hypertension, dysipidemia, overweight, obesity, um sleep apnea, um fatty liver, all of those things. I think that I think those are the main points that I want to highlight about insulin resistance and nutrition.
 
 
00:41:57
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Any thoughts or follows that
Dr. Naomi Myhill: That's great. That's great, Molly. Um, what I would just ask is, um, so you've actually stated really clearly how that contributes to kind of health seeker goal of um, weight loss and kind of reducing that insulin resistance. But what factors kind of moderate the effectiveness of that type of diet? Are there specific factors? You alluded to this before, but can you just describe specifically relating to this target of um insulin resistance? Are there specific factors or constraints that the health seekers might have that might limit their kind of ability to have that type of diet? And what would you recommend for them?
Mollie Dwivedi: So, okay. So, the main question is um are are there are there factors that may limit people's ability to to really increase their amount of whole plant foods eaten?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Exactly. Yes.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, um so it's really important that we think of this as a very long-term plan.
 
 
00:43:01
 
Mollie Dwivedi: This is not something that I want people to do over, you know, 48 hours, two weeks. This is something that requires a lot of ongoing followup because we're talking about making substitutions to the foods that people are often eating every single day. So, we need to find suitable alternatives that people find appealing um and that they enjoy that go along with their family. So there's just a lot of of um um societal and cultural factors that take this into account. Um and the so so so that is I would say the the one of the biggest if not the biggest factor in making these dietary changes. Um, so that's the the first thing is that um this takes a long time to make to make dietary changes and I'm okay with that because I want it to be sustainable. I want this to be a lifetime thing. I'm looking to get um you know decades of gains here and I do not expect you know Rome wasn't built in a day. This takes a long time. Um so um that's that's the first thing.
 
 
00:44:09
 
Mollie Dwivedi: The second thing is is also GI considerations. So um so people if we dramatically increase fiber intake in a quick period of time people will have a lot of bloating gas can even worsen constipation temporarily. Um and so we want to increase the fiber content slowly and we can do that with very small changes. I mean adding flax seeds, chia seeds to to people's yogurt for for example or um you know making a a smoothie a couple times a week that has um some of these foods in here. So um we want to slowly increase the fiber intake and that is considering people's GI considerations. Um another common consideration um too is a a really a huge consideration is ensuring that people um are have the knowledge and the tools to construct a wellbalanced diet. So people when a very common mistake is people in this realm will start eating kind of like exclusively fruits and non-starchy vegetables which is not a healthy or sustainable dietary pattern. It's not enough calories um and it's not enough um it's often not enough fat and protein.
 
 
00:45:25
 
Mollie Dwivedi: And so we really want to be sure that people can understand how what their what their plates should look like and what is constitutes a well- balanced diet. And in that in that vein with um with protein as well is we need to consider if people are regularly engaging in exercise which hopefully they are. And if they are engaging in exercise regularly, then we do want them to have higher protein intake relative to um what non-ex exercising people do. And that also applies to people over the age of 65 as well. Um so people over the age of 65 and people that are exercising, we want them to get at least 1.2 grams per kilogram of of body weight um of proteal protein per day. Um, now I hesitate on that because we with um obesity, especially higher classes of obesity with a BMI of over 35 and 40, uh, we want to consider more lean body weight rather than total body weight for grams of of protein. Um, and because otherwise we're probably very much overestimating the amount of protein um, that those individuals need.
 
 
00:46:38
 
Mollie Dwivedi: And so we do want to keep that in mind. And um if we know that about 96% of Americans at least um exceed the very minimum protein that non-ex exercising adults need. So we know that you know the general omnivorous population is getting enough protein um on a on a daily basis. Now, that goes down a little bit when we're talking about people who exercise, but um I have less concerns um for for people who are are eating um things like um um a lot of plant proteins and then also, you know, poultry and eggs. If people if their preference is to continue eating those foods, I'm not I'm not so concerned um with with their protein needs. But if people, you know, choose to adopt a a plant-based diet, which I think is a very healthful um uh dietary pattern, and I is actually my preferred dietary pattern for minimizing risk of chronic diseases and and improving longevity, then we just do need to um think very carefully about um supplementing usually with protein. People often um can't get enough.
 
 
00:47:48
 
Mollie Dwivedi: I shouldn't say that. It it just requires a lot of planning. um it requires a lot of planning that um many people are too busy or not interested in doing. And so kind of using protein supplementation as a safeguard to make sure um that exercising adults or adults over the age of 65 are getting hitting at least that 1.2 grams per kilogram of of body weight um for protein. But the thing that I will say is there is we have a very protein centric culture and there is all of this emphasis on protein. But what we're neglecting is that when people are eating omnivorous diets, we should be concerned about their vitamins, minerals, nutrients, antioxidants. Because in an general omnivorous diet and at least the standard American diet, which is what a lot of people eat, they're getting way probably too much protein and they're lacking a lot of vitamins and minerals. The studies really show that is very common. And so I'm concerned about protein intake in in certain populations, but I'm actually more concerned about people eating enough whole plant foods in general and our traditional pattern.
 
 
00:48:57
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So the the the long and the the long and the short of it is that everybody needs to have a well-balanced diet. And I am I have dietary considerations and concerns for ev every person no matter what kind of diet they're eating because it takes a lot of work to get a well- balanced diet, no matter what your dietary pattern is. So sorry that was really long-winded.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: No, that's great. That that's a great level of detail, Wally. I think you actually you answered kind of more than what my question was, which was which is great because I think we can add that in. Um Bab, I think that that covers kind of nutrition. Um should we go back to physical activity and and circle back to that?
Mollie Dwivedi: Yes. So, uh physical activity. So, um the goal is to increase moderate minutes of weekly moderate or vigorous um physical activity, whatever the the patient's preference is. Um and ensure that they are um strength training all major muscle groups at least two days per week.
 
 
00:50:00
 
Mollie Dwivedi: um and balance training for adults over the age of 65. So that is that is my my my primary goal. Um and the interventions um start with asking people what they like to do, what how how do they prefer to move their bodies, what is it that they enjoy doing? Um we part of that as a part of that intervention um educate them about the difference versus of light moderate and vigorous physical activity and educate them so they can identify um what level of of what intensity of physical activity they're engaging in. I personally like the talk test. I think that that's just a very um accessessible way for people to to understand their their level of exertion and and intensity. So again, coming back to to education is as being key so that people feel confident in doing that exercise routine. I like people to track their exercise to see where they are landing um on this on on our goals because if we can't measure it, we can't improve it. Um and so I do like when people track it one way or another.
 
 
00:51:11
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um so we can query the logs to see if people are making you know improvements or if they're you know or they're maintaining their level of physical activity which is adequate. So um so that is um how I how I approach that. I of course look for um things that may complicate exercise. So in the medical lens we of course um I like the ACSM pre-articipation exercise screening tool. I think that's a a really nice tool to understand if people are at risk for complications with particularly starting an exercise program. I think that's important. Um specifically the people that I worry about are of course people with um chronic pain um and muscularkeeletal issues that predispose them to injury. Um also people uh with diabetes who are on hypoglycemic agents. So those are going to be the sulfano uras and the um insulin. Uh so if people are taking those medications need to kind of know um I want to know where their hemoglobin A1C is at because if their A1C is pretty low, if they're below 6.5 um and they're on insulin or soponal uras, they are going to be at higher risk for exercise induced hypoglycemia.
 
 
00:52:33
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So we need to assess that maybe adjust their regimen um to to be sure that it is you know safe for them to participate in exercise. Um you know this is where CGMs could are really fantastic and and can really shine because they can alert people to hypoglycemia and we can query it to see what's going on throughout the day and when they're exercising. Um so for designing um the interventions so those are kind of and then also thinking about cardiovascular disease, renal disease as well. Um are people at risk of of having events um those are very commonly comorbid with um with type 2 diabetes. So very you know careful consideration of their cardiovascular status. Um but that also takes into account um their current activity regimen. So what are they doing? Do they have symptoms in any of these conditions? Again, all this refers to that ACSM um pre-participation exercise screening. Um and so kind of yeah, honing in with um people with um insulin resistance, we really want to, you know, optimize their lean muscle mass and and focus on that.
 
 
00:53:49
 
Mollie Dwivedi: um and with with strength training. And so this is, you know, really where I kind of hand the baton to our performance experts to get people teed up with us because they're really the um going to be far and away u more knowledgeable about inter implementing these um interventions for improving lean muscle mass and um aerobic capacity as well. So, kind of on the medical side, I'm thinking about things that could get them into danger um with with exercise, but you know, that's pretty um pretty uncommon as as long as we're very intentional about how how we start this and educating the patient about how to self-monitor themselves for these conditions. Um and being sure that we are keeping patient preferences top of mind and that we are we're tracking and working with them very closely. Again, a lot of behavior change strategies to engage um people in this and and continue um continue engagement. This is not um again another situation where Rome wasn't built in a day. And so if they don't do any exercise for one or two weeks, I'm not too worried about it because we need to just kind of focus on um moving forward in the long term.
 
 
00:55:04
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay, that's great. I've got a couple of follow-up questions. Um, so I think you mentioned around the threshold of of physical activity. Can you clarify what the threshold is um for um improving insulin resistance specifically?
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, I'm sorry. I didn't hear the first part of what you said.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah. So, um, you mentioned that there's a specific threshold for physical activity they should be meeting, and I imagine that is just a general threshold, but if you can let me know what the the number is in terms of is it the number of minutes they should be doing per week. Um, what's the threshold that you recommend or prescribe to your health seekers who come to you with this issue?
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. So, let me actually look this up real quick because the diabetes prevention program, I want to say they used actually a little bit higher than 150 minutes per week.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: And followup question to that while while you're looking will be what are you tracking specifically?
 
 
00:56:19
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: So you you did mention there um you know like sometimes they might have kind of monitors or you know watches that are tracking exercise. Are you looking at the minutes? Are you looking at the number of sessions per week? Um what's the Yeah. What's your general kind of thoughts on that?
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. Yeah. So um so I generally am looking at um I'm trying to get the um so there's there's actually a um there's actually kind of an an initiative called the physical activity vital sign and it is a a movement to establish physical activity as a vital sign when you go to a clinic and the physical activity vital sign is collected when you're getting your blood pressure and your weight and your height and all these things. Um, and it is to quantify the number of minutes of moderate to v vigorous physical activity per week. And so that is kind of how I think about physical activity is how many minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week.
 
 
00:57:23
 
Mollie Dwivedi: That is one of the most important um measurements in in my mind in terms of physical activity. And then also the number of days of strength training per week. So that is what I like. I like people to track their physical activity in whatever way they find suitable. Everybody's different in how they want to do this and we want to lead with a patiententric approach for them to do what works for them instead of having to fit them into our framework. So I like them to track in whatever way works best for them. Again, I have historically been limited by technology on this, but there are some platforms out there that I'm using right now like a platform called Healthy um that actually you can connect with wearables and I can see all their workouts. And so, you know, if I had all the tools and the team and everything available, I would love for us to track people's heart rate and see what zone they're getting into with their so we can very accurately capture if they're light, moderate, vigorous physical activity.
 
 
00:58:27
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, so that's what I want would want people to track. I would I would love as much detail as possible and if we could put it accurately categorize it into these silos of where people are falling for their aerobic physical activity. And then similarly for strength training I would love a similar sufficient amount of detail. When you say strength training all major muscle groups the chances that all patients can kind of accurately understand and know what that is and do that execute that is like you know few and far between. But if we had, you know, programs where we could ensure that our, you know, coaches and trainers are implementing that um and can check off that people are training all major all major muscle groups two days per week. That would be, you know, preferable. Um so the uh does that answer that question for tracking?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah. Yeah, that's great.
Mollie Dwivedi: Okay.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: So the difference they you've got minutes, you've got number of sessions and then kind of ideally getting heart rate so you can monitor intensity level as well of those sessions.
 
 
00:59:34
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: So that's like wearable integration which yeah it's something I think as part of Cascade will be integrated. So yeah.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yes, exactly. Exactly. Um so um so the diabetes prevention program does does reinforce that at least 100 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise. But the participants in the DPP um did mean met a a mean of a 208 minutes per week of moderate intensity and sustained an average of 189 minutes per week. Um so so they did have a slightly higher um level of of moderate intensity physical activity per week. And I mean that makes sense. you know, we do see incremental improvements in various health measures as you get above 150 minutes uh per week. Um so, so I anchor on that 150 minutes um and and encourage people to go beyond that um if if they if they enjoy it and encourage them to do so if if they're interested. Um the other thing I actually did not uh mention that is being studied a lot more is um also people's daily steps.
 
 
01:00:55
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So there's a lot more data coming out now showing that like 7 to 8,000 steps per day um does improve you know a lot of cardium metabolic health outcomes and even mortality. So that's another measure that I would love to have if if people have it. Um I think of steps as a separate construct from moderate to vigorous um and strength training. I put it kind of in its own category. Um, I like people to I I I I my my personal um gestalt is that the moderate to vigorous physical activity is going to be more impactful than than steps in terms of powering people's health health outcomes. I don't know that we have any data to support that claim. Um, but I I I encourage people to focus on that primarily and consider their steps as well. Alternatively, if you have somebody that cannot will not does not want to exercise, then I will encourage them to increase their steps. Um, you know, using seven or 8,000 is an optimal threshold, but just like any physical activity, any incremental improvement is um towards those goals is meaningful.
 
 
01:02:13
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, and so it really starts with where people are at and helping them move the needle in a way that works for them.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Great. Thanks for that. Um, just on physical activity and it might be that the kind of strength coach that you defer to would answer this question, but what's the usual follow-up timeline? Um, if you have prescribed this physical activity and is it the same timeline as you've suggested for the other lifestyle medicine pillars as well? And then again, similarly, and you've kind of alluded to it a little bit, but how do you sort of adjust that physical activity intervention based off of their kind of current state of mind as well or current state of being, or is that something that you would defer to kind of a coach to do for
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. So, um, so the first question of, um, Okay, wait. I lost I just lost your your first question.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Sorry, I should ask one question at a time, shouldn't I?
 
 
01:03:16
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Sorry. No, no, no, you're here.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Um, so the first question was the follow-up timeline. Um, so yeah.
Mollie Dwivedi: Great. Yes. So, followup timeline. Um, I find that exercise, uh, I I tend to follow up a little bit less frequently than things like diet and sleep. Um, it just takes longer, um, for people to to work this into their routine. Um, so I generally do four weeks on physical activity. Um, again, if people are highly motivated and they're ready to go, um, we can do two weeks, but I find more that like four to six weeks is typically better follow-up timeline for for physical activity. Um and then yeah, so the customization of physical activity interventions, I mean, is just is is paramount. And I think that um yeah, people's baseline level of physical activity is one of the most important things um in in assessing this intervention. Um and so how I think about this about on the medical side and then versus um uh delegating to an exercise professional um for people's baseline um state the things that I need to consider on the medical side are number one are they doing any activity right now?
 
 
01:04:44
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Are they doing any are they engaged in um moderate intensity physical activity at least 30 minutes three times a day. That is what the ACSM exercise screener um kind of takes into account um when you're determining if somebody is currently physically active. Are they engaging in 30 minutes three times a week? Um and if they are then the next well regardless then the second question is do they have symptoms or a diagnosis of systemic conditions cardiovascular disease um diabetes kidney disease um muscularkeeletal impairments cancer things like that those are things that that I'm thinking about if they are deemed to be stable um there's a lot of things that kind of go into this But um if they are deemed to be stable and exercising, they can go on to you know reasonable progression with a trained exercise professional. People that have more advanced conditions like um like cancer undergoing um current you know treatment with you know things like chemotherapy or that have like metastic cancer. They should probably work with more um you know cancer certified trainers for example.
 
 
01:06:02
 
Mollie Dwivedi: um people with um diabetes um who aren't on any sort of people with diabetes can can work with with exercise professionals very safely. People with cardiovascular disease is one um with significant cardiovascular disease. So chest pain um people who have recently had a heart attack um or a stroke um people who have heart failure or have symptoms um of shortness of breath and things like that. um should kind of undergo consideration for a supervised exercise program. So those are the things that I'm thinking about on the medical side of things. Um those are kind of very few and far between and we'll pro well I shouldn't say that they're not very few and far between. They're less common and um other than that um I think exercise professionals are are fantastic at understanding um people's uh baseline and and how to progress. Um, I do think that we can always improve. I think everybody who works with patients can benefit from motivational interviewing. Um, and instead of saying this is your exercise program, do it.
 
 
01:07:11
 
Mollie Dwivedi: It's really putting the patient in the driver's seat. Um, and using those motivational interviewing techniques, um, to get them a program that the patient really wants to and enjoys doing.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay, great. Um, are there any other interventions relating specifically to insulin resistance that we haven't spoke about?
Mollie Dwivedi: So yeah. So let's see. Sleep, nutrition, exercise. Um um those are the one.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Was stress one was stress one that you mentioned before or Yeah.
Mollie Dwivedi: Yeah. Yeah. So to be honest, I'm not I mean I I do I I do think there is I do think there is some established link between chronic stress levels and um and things like insulin resistance. It's less my impression is that it is less well established than the other pillars. Um, but I do think that it's it's something to to be mindful of. Um, and we talked about kind of the assessments last time, but interventions, you know, this is where where I think um, if if we identify that people do have chronic stress.
 
 
01:08:33
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, then the interventions, this is where I really do like to focus on things like using exercise as a stress reducer. Um, any sort of movement. That way we're kind of covering you know two aspects of lifestyle um with one um and really whatever stress reducing techniques that people like and the another one that has a lot of evidence for it is mindfulness-based stress reduction MBSR. So um mindfulness based practices are also kind of a cornerstone of interventions that I like to recommend for stress. Um the other thing is to consider is um especially with people with type two diabetes that thinking about the you know mental health and weight management um um aspects as well is that we do know that people um who have type 2 diabetes do have um commonly increased risk of of mental health conditions as well. So this is where screening becomes very important and um assessing and treating those um appropriately. Um so those are the lifestyle um the main lifestyle factors that I'm thinking about for insulin resistance. Now we haven't talked about the conventional medical management for insulin resistance.
 
 
01:09:52
 
Mollie Dwivedi: Um, what I'm thinking though is I can um I the ADA, the American Diabetes Association, you know, has a standard treatment algorithm. Um, and that has changed over time. I need to look up kind of what the most recent one is, but but basically there's there's a treatment algorithm and for years the the first line medication for type 2 diabetes is metformin. Um some people with pre-diabetes can be treated with metformin as well. Um and so I will be I I'm my personal preference is to be more aggressive. So if people want to do metformin plus lifestyle interventions, I'm I'm all for it with the understand that we can always peel back or stop the metformin. Um so that is definitely a um shared decision-m um thing that I I offer metformin to people that have pre-diabetes and that's supported supported by the ADA. But lifestyle interventions being foundational. Now with type two diabetes um the the practice has changed recently with the GLP1 agonists um particularly if people have overweight or obesity cardiovascular disease risk factors um and then so so in terms of a pharmacologic treatment for type two diabetes um I think it it depends on the patients um I'm just trying to be like very brief and quick about this um it depends on the patient's um A1C at time of diagnosis.
 
 
01:11:27
 
Mollie Dwivedi: So the higher the A1C, the more aggressive you're going to be with their initial pharmacologic treatments. But if we identify it early, which is more often than the ca more often the case, we can start with metformin or depending on their other coorbidities, a GLP-1 um or an SGLT2 inhibitor for example um depending on what other chronic conditions that they have. But the GLP1s um I think are are one of my favorite because of the um often comorbid overweight um uh obesity, hypertension, um fatty liver, um metabolic syndrome, dysipidemia, all of those things. It can treat all of these things with with one medication um or and I should say improve many of these factors um with with one medication. So, um, I kind of I I basically would reference the ADA pharmacologic therapy for type two diabetes for our kind of conventional pathway. Um, I think they do a really nice job of of laying out all those considerations.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay, that's great. We'll we'll definitely have a look at that. I think um considering the time we have three minutes left to the end, so we'll finish the interview there for the benefit of the transcript. We are finished with the interview.
