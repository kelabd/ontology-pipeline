Ontology Knowledge Capture - Matt Jordan - 2025_08_07 15_58 BST – Transcript
[00:00:00] Okay, so for the purpose of the transcript, we'll start the, the interview now. So thanks for joining us, Matt. First question we're gonna ask is, is to get a bit of background and context. So what are your primary areas of expertise or focus? So we are looking to try and capture the domain names here and descriptions of those.
Yeah. Yeah, a hundred percent. So, uh, probably domain number one would be, um, strength training. Uh, domain number two would be neuromuscular adaptations to strength training. Um, domain three would probably be, um, uh, return to play, return to performance after injury and rehabilitation. Um, knee injuries. Um, and I would say tr and broadly, uh, s.
Under the umbrella of sports science, uh, training for [00:01:00] performance periodization, um, and then probably under the umbrella of, of health and fitness, uh, training for like longevity, um, injury prevention functionality across the lifespan.
Brilliant. Thanks for that. So we'll go into, um, one of those domains specifically is that we will probably, we've lessed quite a lot there, so we probably won't get through all of them today. I think, we'll, we'll try and do a good job at going through one of those in, in some details. We overlap a little bit, so, yeah.
Yeah. Fab. Um, so if we think about strength, um, when you're answering these questions. Yeah. So when a, when an athlete or a health seeker. Kind of presents a concern to you, how do you typically assess them? So what we're looking for here is just an overview of [00:02:00] any initial assessments, things that you would look for, and why you'd be doing that.
We don't necessarily want a lot of detail right now, and we'll, we'll go to go into that later. So, kind of high level, when a, when a athlete comes to you or presents a, a concern or a problem, what's, what's your next steps? Um, so next steps would be to, um, capture context and an interview. Um, I have a form that I use for that interview, but I would walk through, um, structured questions around, uh, their history, their goals, um, what, what's limiting them, previous injury history, um, uh, you know, nutritional habits, lifestyle habits, to get a, a picture of, uh, kind of complete picture of who I'm dealing.
Um, the second piece would be to, uh, understand whether or not I'm dealing with somebody who, um, is, uh, gonna need that, like one good tweak in [00:03:00] solution and who's not really ready yet for the full meal deal. Um, versus, and, and maybe somebody for whom things are working kind of well. And there's things we need to keep, and consistency needs to be sort of like maintained, uh, or, uh, whether or not this person's more on the other end of the spectrum, which would be like, I'm a, I'm a blank slate.
Gimme everything you got. Um, let's, let's do this. Um, and so I kind of gauge where they are based on that. And then I tailor my next steps, which is gonna be to start to collect some information on whether or not I need to be more on this side or more on this side. Um, I guess moving, moving from more from one to the other.
Let's just say what everything would look like. Um. After, uh, after my interview and after really establishing where they are, where they want to go, where they've been, uh, where they live, what they do, um, you know, their, their, their, their, their concerns, uh, you know, their aspirations. [00:04:00] Um, I normally start with a movement assessment.
And that movement assessment is typically, um, you know, it can be somewhat structured, but it also, uh, begins usually with like, uh, some sort of, like, I usually take 'em out on the track to be honest with you, and I have them move a little bit, do a warmup. Uh, it's nice, it's relaxed. I can watch their, their movement patterns.
They're, you know, how they create tric stiffness, you know, just get a, get a feel for what their competencies are. Um, from there, it's kind of a triage, like if it's, if, if it if through the, you know, and, and. In the warmup, we're covering all the basics, right? So like, squatting, hinging, pushing, pulling, rotation, and I'm getting a sense of how they compensate and create good positions and postures and like, you know, uh, strategies around do they hold the breath every time they try to do a plank or are they able to create good positions and postures that relate to their sport?
Um, from there, the main, the main bifurcation in the tree is, did anything cause pain? [00:05:00] And if anything was like, yeah, that I can't do that, I've got pain with this, or I've got, um, a, a severe limitation that takes me down a different path, which is gonna be a little bit more clinical. Sure. And that's gonna include looking at things like, you know, uh, st I, I, I call it a stability mobility assessment, but essentially, you know, from head to toe, you know, like how is your range of motion and control of that range, um, down through the chain.
And usually what I'm looking for there is I'm looking for that red flag that, like, that hip, that doesn't move that spine, that, that, you know, that hinges at the wrong spot or, you know, that that glaring opportunity for us to kind of clean things up and to, to be able to get, you know, get a, get a, get some more, um, more, more availability for the athlete.
If I go down the other side and it's like, no, there, there's no limitations. Like they're not in pain, there's no, there's no, uh, concerns. The primary question I'm trying to figure out is, [00:06:00] um, what movements are you, um, able to own and perform really, really well? So that when I begin in the process of designing a program, I'm applying the exercises and the modalities that are the best fit for your body.
So, you know, I'm trying to understand like, you know, where, where are you in all the basic competencies and, um, what, um, what level are we at? Are we at a really rudimentary level where we're gonna just like, kind of work on, you know, um, uh, low level movement control and just sort of awareness. Um, do we need to kind of go back to some rudimentary sort of like, um, um.
You know, I would call them almost like yoga esque positions and postures, or are you somebody that's got a lot of command and we can start to really aggressively push into, you know, into different types of movement patterns that'll be more challenging. Um, so that's kind of my movement assessment [00:07:00] hierarchy and, and kind of takes me in a bifurcation based on like, you know, movement, pattern, pain, no pain, uh, yes pain.
Okay, then next, go down that, that tree, uh, no pain, keep going, you know, and progressively increase the demands. Um, as I walk through, uh, by the end of it, my goal is to have captured a really good sense of, um, what are you ready for? And, uh, by what are you ready for? This means that now I have got a good, a good picture of, of what we wanna do and, and where we want to go with our, even with our testing, because that's kind of the next step.
Um. After that, usually, uh, depending upon the day and depending upon, uh, how much time we have, at some point in there, I usually do a skinfold uh, evaluation. Um, and Skinfold evaluation for me is, um, looking at, uh, yeah, you know, obviously just overall body composition, uh, where people deposit fat. Um, getting a, a bit of a picture there of, [00:08:00] of what might be happening.
And I usually stitch together my body composition assessment with your lifestyle and kind of like stress level alcohol intake, um, regular, regular use of cannabis, um, uh, vegetarian, vegan, high protein. Like what, what sort of, what sort of world do we live in? And I used to do a pretty formal diet record, uh, for this.
Um, and I still, I still do to some extent, but I, I find that it's a little bit cumbersome and it's easier just to kind of start to establish a relationship around food with a person. So I'll ask questions like, you know, what did you have for breakfast? What did you have for dinner? Um, tell me what your past couple of days looked like, but just get a picture of that.
But that's sort of stitched up against the body to, um, then moving from, um, from that, now we're getting into, uh, the actual, uh, I would call it the more formal testing. Um, obviously a big cornerstone of this is gonna be looking [00:09:00] at, um, um, some forced plate analysis. So, um, I'll, I'll typically, like the way I envision it is cross a spectrum of tasks.
So, um, on the far right hand side would be biometric function. And I, I'm a big believer in even looking at this in older adults. Um. Obviously in an older adult, um, you have to ask a question, are you ready for the movement? That's, but that's with everybody, right? So if you're not ready for it, I'm not testing it.
Um, you know, maybe that's something that we're gonna put down the road. But let's say that you've got the competencies. So I go from a task of, uh, repeat plyometric function, which I prefer the repeat comp test. Um, I don't, I, um, and drop jumping for me is I've never loved that test. Um, I think there's a lot of limitations establishing the box height, um, how people modify their step off.
Um, you could, you could watch that with a, you know, with an expert eye. And it's really hard to, it's really easy to miss when people are, um, changing their landing. Um, and I, and so I just don't love it. And [00:10:00] with repeat hopping, what I'm aiming to do is to get a picture of what the plyometric function is.
And so, um, whether it's a double leg, uh, repeat hop test or a single leg repeat hot test, which would have a much higher demand. Um, I get sort of an, an idea of, of tric function. Um, coming off the back end of that test, obviously we'll probably talk about some of the metrics that come off of it. Um, next, uh, body here is counter movement jump testing, um, which I'll use kind of as cornerstone, uh, for either, um, you know, eventually monitoring or like as part of my routine, kind of weekly or bi bimonthly, uh, evaluations.
Um, counter movement, jump testing, uh, will be two legs and one leg. And then I have some sort of strength task. And that strength task is probably, in most circumstances, gonna be either on like a standardized, kind of like robotic leg press type device that, you know, I would have access to in my world. But, um, let's say we don't [00:11:00] have access to that.
It would probably be some form of loaded jump, um, which has a pretty good, uh, relationship with your maximal strength. So, you know, load you up with, uh, 30 to 60% of your body mass, have you perform a counter movement jump. Um, it's as much of a diagnostic for me to understand how you create that movement as it is like the actual performance outcome.
So with all tasks, it's not just like X's and O's and gimme the data. It's like I coach through it and I, I take a look at the force curves. I watch how you create the movement strategy. Um, I keep it very open. I like to, I like to probe and, and understand like, what do you do to figure out the movement? So when a counter movement jump, it'll be like, hands on your hips, just jump as high as you can and do you jump slow?
Do you jump, uh, do you jump really fast? Do you just send a lot? Um, are you, uh, you know, uh, waiting one side more than the other? Like little things that just help me, you know, kind of get a picture of, of how that, that strategy is. And then a loaded condition is just another task constraint to me, right? So it's like.
Now do the task [00:12:00] with extra load. And do you have the strength to be able to like, create the suit, same movement pattern, or do you have to like really move back away and go towards more like a, like a squat jump or something like that? Um, so that's my strength picture from, from there, you know, uh, we'll get into, uh, uh, um, typically like upper body, uh, strength assessments, depending upon the individual.
Um, normally I keep it pretty simple and I'll do kind of like a pull up, um, as a, as a kind of cornerstone test. Um, you know, pull up for me again, as much about the movement pattern as it is about the number. I don't really care about any reps you can do. I'm just looking for like, how do you create pulling actions.
Um, if it was an athlete where upper body strength was really, really crucial, I, I probably would include a press as well. Um, and the press could be more, uh, again, along the lines of what we do for the lower body where we're trying to create like a, maybe a [00:13:00] move, a move a standard load with speed versus like try to, uh, lift as much weight as you can.
Um, back end of that is always, uh, what I call like basic movement competency. But I look at things like, you know, um, again, so you're watching through the movement patterns. Like I can see a lot of like, you know, for instance, like, let, let's say you're, let's take a single leg jump. Um, honestly, if you think about a spectrum of moving on one leg, right?
Um, you could move on one leg by like, let's say at the far left hand side of it would be like, can you be on a box and put your hands on your hips and do a quarter depth step down really slow and controlled. Um, you know, maintaining good pelvic alignment, good hip knee, ankle alignment, um, you know, you got good range to be able to do it.
Um, you know, moving up one step might be something like a split squat or a split stance. Moving up a step might be now you're on a box and you're doing a full range of motion, uh, squat off the [00:14:00] box, you know, so for instance, with ski, I would always have that as part of my, my progression. And then as you come along the way, you know, maybe at the far end is the single leg jump and then the repeat hop.
So it's like single leg movement strategies. And I, and I think about it in like planes, right? So we're in, uh, sagittal plane. We're, um, and we're moving from slow to fast and from simple to more complex, um, and more reactive. Um, I, I kind of see it as one through line. So, you know, my single leg jump is not just like, did you hit the power or did you hit the jump height?
It's like, where are you on your single leg moving competency? So everything's got that kind of lens, right? So even a bilateral counter movement jump, it's like, what's your movement competency? Where are you at? It's like, oh wow, you know, you, you compensate. Um, you know what? You compensated with the overhead squat with a dowel.
Okay. Well that to me is sort of like giving me a sense of on two legs, where are you fitting? Now you may still do a counter movement jump, but [00:15:00] um, at the end of the day, I'm trying to gather that information to kind of like pin you on that, that spectrum. Um, so kind of in broad now, that's kind of the strengths side.
Um, it's got movement competency and it's got, obviously got output. So let's just say that that's, that's kind of created across those tasks. Um, there may be some, uh, cases for specific sports. I've already mentioned skiers, for example, but sometimes with like some athletes, you are interested in creating more, I hate to say sports specific, but I'll say sports specific tests that are.
Kind of con contextual. Um, you know, if you're a, if you're a hockey player, maybe we do wanna look at lateral, uh, lateral movement competencies and, and different forms of deceleration tasks on one leg. Um, if you're a skier, you know, being able to get outta the hole in a, in a jump where you have to like, generate a lot of force to get outta the bottom position, uh, maybe a tennis player creating some movement, uh, on, on, uh, [00:16:00] how you stack and create good positions and postures moving around the court.
All of these things might creep in, but that would be much less structured. Um, so now kind of, that's the strength domain, movement domain covered off. And now the next domain, um, would typically be some level of like, um, let's just say anaerobic, aerobic, uh, testing, depending upon the context. Um, you know, I'm not, I'm not a big fan on just doing it arbitrarily, but.
Um, you know, typically to get like, either, uh, a sense of like training zones or to get and capture maximal aerobic power, uh, anaerobic capacity, um, you know, pushing people into that, uh, that tough zone a little bit. I like to see how people react to that. I like to know like what, you know, what, what your response is gonna be to that physiologically, but also just kind of psychologically.
Um, so on, on one end, [00:17:00] I've got the, if I'm just using force plates, I've got the 82nd repeated squad jump test, um, where we do like one jump every four seconds for 80 seconds. Um, I can get a picture of your total anaerobic capacity, your fatigue index, just get a sense of like, um, obviously, uh, how you tolerate such, uh, such a, a task.
Um, and then if, uh, you know, uh, if I, I go to the other side, uh, the steel classic on a, a cycle ter and doing a, you know, doing an incremental. Um, you know, up to MAP, uh, doing the, um, uh, anaerobic speed reserve is another one that I sometimes will, will look at. You know, the difference between your max aerobic power and your, and your, and your speed.
Like those are very prescriptive for me, but it helps me to, like, as we get into the next stage, which is gonna be putting pen to paper and designing programming, I just kind of need a bit of sense of like, okay, what is your power up? What, what, what is your MAP if we're gonna be using a bike and sort of [00:18:00] prescribing.
Uh, the, the, the, the, the intervals, like what is your max heart rate? Um, you know, so I can determine what your zones are and be much more surgical with like, how I give you your, your training prescription. Um, what is your anaerobic speed reserve? So I can kind of understand like where you fit relative to others, but yourself too, like in terms of like your speed and your, and, and your MAP or MAS.
Um, but I don't, I don't go much beyond that and I don't really go into the physiology. Like I don't, I really don't get much out of metabolic carts and VOT max testing and, and stuff. And about as deep as I'm going there is, uh, heart rate and maybe blood lactate. If, if, depending upon, uh, if you're a cyclic sport athlete, like a speed skater, I'll probably be taking some blood lactate measurements.
If you're an alpine skier, I'll be taking some blood lactate measurements. Um, if you are, uh, weekend warrior, uh. Who cares? Like, let's just, let's [00:19:00] just get, let's just get your MAT, let's just get your max heart rate and I can work with that and, and away we go. Um, so that kind of comprises now the, yeah, like the, the movement, the strength component and the power component and the plyometric component, uh, the energy system component.
Um, the, the other offshoot obviously is baseline blood. Um, I, I love baseline blood. I think that's a really nice picture of, of like the person and where they are. Um, super informative, uh, especially if you're catching red flags. Um, and then the final piece is if I can, if I've got the ability and I can tap into, um, like resting heart rate, HRV sleep, um, I'll, I'll typically do that, but I'll, I'll, I, I don't like formally as that, uh, start, that just becomes part of my routine monitoring and now.
I can kind of gauge recovery status a little bit, uh, longitudinally. Um, sometimes I find it's like a little bit tricky to be like, how do you sleep? And I mean, I don't know, like I [00:20:00] could have very variable sleep. Um, I find it's easier to kind of like have it in the back of my head that, you know, um, you know, I wanna start monitoring this a little bit.
And tracking, obviously you asked that in the interview. Like, tell me about your sleep. I sleep great. I sleep like a rock. That could be as, as much like of a concern as somebody who doesn't sleep well. Uh, somebody who falls asleep in a second and like, you know, and, and feels like they get to bed early. No, no problem.
So I'm kind of like aware of these contextual pieces. Um, and um, I guess at the end of the day, once we get rolling, um, I'll get that baseline kind of monitoring data in the back of my head from, from what we're gonna do. Um, yeah. Uh, I guess the only other thing that I ask is prior to putting pen to paper and programming is, uh, tell me about what your training looks like.
You know, what do you, what do you like? What, what, what do you prefer? Oh, I love deadlifts. You know, uh, uh, you know, I love pressing and pulling. Uh, you know, I don't, I try to avoid, [00:21:00] uh, certain movement patterns because my body just doesn't like it. Um, you know, I like to kind of know a little bit like what you've been up to.
Um, so that's, that, that was, that usually comes through the interview. But like, um, it is a, it is a, it is when I go down now to put pen to paper and start to progress and do things, it's like, I kind of wanna know what you have been used to. Um, 'cause it gives me a lot of sense of like what, where I want to take it for, you know, for, for optimizing for the individual.
Um, get a lot of clues outta that info. Um, I think that's probably pretty much the full meal deal. I'm sure there's a couple things maybe I'm missing, but like, that's generally the battery. Yeah, that's, that's great. Matt. I think, so just to kind of reflect on what you just said there. So when an athlete or a health seeker comes in, the first thing you'll do is, is you'll have the, the interview with them.
You'll ask them those questions. You tend to do like a [00:22:00] movement assessment movement screen to really understand how their, how their movement, rather than any type of objective data to begin with. And then you start to do those more specific tests around strength, power, anaerobic capacity. So you mentioned quite a lot of, uh, assessments there, which is great.
So I just wanna bring it back to some of those. But firstly, what at Cascade we're trying to build, um, obviously the kind of your premium service, but then also like the digital, like level three service. So it'd be great to hear kind of from your perspective, um, if we are thinking specifically about.
Strength and power, what assessments would you use to assess that construct with both unlimited and then limited and moderate resource if you can? Just like, what would be your ideal and, and, [00:23:00] yeah. Yeah. Totally. Yeah, a hundred percent. Yeah. And, and, and just one, one thing to capture that I think like maybe didn't come through, but I do feel like it's a crucial piece is, um, there's a bifurcation in the tree at every stage.
So like, I'm trying to figure out what are you ready for? And, you know, in that scale, I am bifurcating. If it's like, oh, I got pain, I got restriction, I can't do that. Um, the movement competency is really clear. I might like per curate at the beginning and be like, we'll do that stuff later. We'll do that stuff as part of training.
You know, I don't need to do all that testing to know if you're strong or not. Um, you know what I'm saying? Like, it's, it's, I can tell if you're strong as we start to train. But, but if, if you're, if you are, but if you are somebody where we want to get all these X's and O's and we really wanna start to track things, right, we can go much more detailed.
Um, so just make sure, like in when you capture, like, 'cause a big part of it that I didn't go in deep is the MSK assessment. And, and, and that's like, you [00:24:00] know, that like if you came to me and you're broken, if you're like, oh my God, I'm torched, you know, I've got injuries and I'm whatever. Like, there's the MSK assessment becomes the full deal deal, right?
It's like head to toe movement control, basic, basic movement competencies, range of motion, you know, you know, stability, mobility, continuum, how do you control range? What's your availability? So it's like there's a little, there's a piece there that, that I think is kind of like my decision tree, which hopefully came through, uh, because it would be the same thing with digital level three, right?
Like, it's like your. In an optimal world with level three, it would be, um, uh, engaging with a chat bot that's basically replicating the questions that I just asked. And it would be conversational you like, tell me about who you are. Tell me about what you like. Tell me about your program. What limits you, what doesn't limit you?
Where are your concerns? And you'd have the ability to extract conversationally some sense of who this person is and what's limiting them. Um, I think that, um, you know, the, the, [00:25:00] the, the way I would do that, um, because I, I would have level three clients through, let's say my website would be, uh, just a zoom in interview.
Um, and, you know, I would be working through and taking notes and like kind of constructing a bit of a puzzle around the person. Um, so I think that's, that's still viable, uh, via, via level three. But obviously I, I think there's a huge opportunity to like. Um, you know, I was thinking about this the other day, Naomi is like, we, we we're in this era where we ask athletes to, um, basically give us digital training diaries.
Like that's how I see, like, when they fill out the logs and the forms, you know, it's like click, click, click, submit. Um, you know, I'm trying to get numbers to what your, uh, training is like. Um, and ACLU hate it. You know, they, they, they can't stand, they can't stand doing that, but a lot of them will keep a very good diary.
And so I feel like there's opportunities in our world right now to create, [00:26:00] you know, these more LLM diaries where it's like. Hey, Naomi. How, how you doing? Hey, I'm great. How was training today? Ah, you know, I, I got some reflections on today's training. You know, it's like I did this, I did that, you know, here's what I'm thinking for this and this, that, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And then, you know, maybe through the conversation, the, the, the chat bots like, Hey, so what was your RP today? Ah, give it about a seven. Like, you're, you're sort of extracting the data points, but it's not, it's like as though you were diary and doing a diary, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is I would really like to establish with a level three at the front end, that sort of like diary process, you know, and that diary process would be like, where I'd like to begin digitally with like, you know, getting information recording and being able to create something that you are, it's your personalized piece that works through me, but you're gonna, you're gonna interact with this as, because we don't wanna just like have a single time point where it's like, tell me everything [00:27:00] about you.
Capture all this information and then, you know, we never really synthesize it and do anything with it again. You know, that's, that's the big gap with level threes. Uh, in my view, uh, this digital piece is like, oh yeah, you're a new, I've got a guy who's in New York City. We walk through, we do a whole entire thing.
He's been training with me for five years, six years, probably even more. Actually, he's been with me forever. Um, you know, it's like a lot of what we did conversationally at the start in our interview is really never really relevant anymore. Like, it's like, I don't know, you just move on and I email 'em or whatever.
But the through line has been lost and, and you know, yet I'm still really wanting to capture information from him. Um, but the problem is, is that the way I'm capturing information requires him to go to his phone and fill out a Google form, which is like, it's really hit and miss and at the end of the day, it's like, it doesn't give me context.
And so, um, I'll just begin by saying level three. I think we could get a very, very long way in my perfect role. [00:28:00] With creating something that's your personal cascade assistant, who's your diary and your interviewer, and who's there with us and copilots us along the way. Um, which I think would be worth its weight in gold.
Um, I, uh, I simplify and dumb it down quite a bit for, for my, uh, my online assessments and stuff like that. Like obviously if you have pain or you have issues, that's still red flag and you know, but what I normally will do is I'll have a, this is my network, right? So if it's like, oh, you're in New York City and you've got a really jacked up ankle, or you're battling a patella tendinopathy, I'll be like, Hey, go see my guy at, you know, X clinic and, you know, I let, then I let him do the NSK assessment and feed that back to me.
Um, which gives me a, like, I guess at the end of the day, allows me to keep the quality, but really lets me know what I'm dealing with. Um, I think that's an important stepping stone. Um, nonetheless, although it's gonna have to be trusted towards somebody else's [00:29:00] process. Um, and then really at the end of the day, I, I, it's kind of a variation of the same thing I do.
Um, do a pull up. Fill me a pull up. Uh, how many pull ups can you do? Okay. There's your strength measure. Um, I'm, I'm a big fan of Plana, um, only because I've been so heavily involved in the validation process. Like I know what I'm dealing with there. Um, and, um, the, the, um, um, the thing I like about it is I can get a picture of your walking patterns, running patterns and jumping patterns and hopping patterns, um, via the insole and, um, so I would normally.
Engage the person and get them sort of equipped with that. And, and we would, we would be able to gather, um, baseline walk, baseline run, uh, and repeat hop test, and then counter movement, jump test and um, you know, and then I do the same thing. Counter movement, jump, single leg counter movement, jump, look at height.
I, I [00:30:00] mean, it's hard to break down. A lot of the other measures are, you know, um, just because of the technology, maybe not quite as, um, informative, but you can get your height, you can get your ground contact times and, and, and double leg hopping. Um, and then, uh, yeah, do a loaded jump, get a, get a measure of jump height.
Um, I feel like the alternative there would be, um, just having a, you know, having a, having a recording on my jump or whatever. Um, the, my Jump app, um, ah, I'm just not a huge fan of it, but like, um, but yeah, I mean, if, if, if the goal is to get a sense of what your leg power is and what your, which strength is, um, I think it's a good, good starting point.
Um, but, uh, really at the end of the day, Naomi, it's just being like basically distilling down the, um, protocol to videoing yourself with some core tasks, you know? So it's like, uh, pushing, you know, push. I usually film a pushup or a dip film, uh, film a pull up, um, film, a [00:31:00] overhead squat with a dowel film, uh, a single lake, squat off a box, uh, film, a film, a hinge movement, um, and then a couple of jumping tasks, and then that's it.
Um, and so, uh, yeah, it's, it's kind of the same thing. I guess what I, what I eliminate is all the, the other pieces of the puzzle. Um, um, you know, I think the other pieces of the puzzle that are, that I described are, uh, where, where they become really useful in my past experience is like if you're working with, let's say, an Olympic athlete.
Those data points and, and I, I'll, I'll just even take a step back. In some ways, cascade is aiming for a similar thing. Like we want, when possible, the highest fidelity data beyond just like my programming, it becomes the goldmine of understanding longitudinally. Like how do people adapt? And so, you know, where I've used it as an example, and, and not to go down a rabbit hole with this, but like, um, it's extensive, but [00:32:00] we need, we need to trust the data and we need to have key indicators that are going to be foundational to how we describe human function.
And so a power jumping based task is, uh, moving beyond just how high did you jump, you know, it's like what is your leg power output? And why that's so important is becomes a crucial. Obviously predictor of functionality with age. It's crucial after injury in terms of restoring performance readiness to get back to sport.
It obviously directly associated with sport performance in a myriad of, of, of places. Um, and I think the science is pretty, pretty, pretty, uh, pretty clear. It's one of the more important mechanical biomarkers that's gonna mark your longevity across the lifespan. So, you know, yes, for you we care, but we also want to know eventually in, in a model where you have the output on the vertical and time along the horizontal and things are changing, we wanna know, [00:33:00] are you changing?
Like you typically see people change, are you way faster in your change rate or are you slower in your change rate? And because we wanna be able to understand who you are relative to, uh, change over time. And so for me, um, I think that like, you know, kind of coming back to level three, um. I would just not be a fan of just kind of stopping at like, um, fill out a form, here's your program.
Um, like everything just kind of goes into the programming part of it. Like I, I think there's a couple of pieces that we just, we would want to have that would be sort of more globally anchored to what we are going to track. So probably, uh, blood testing would be a kind of a core anchor. You know, um, the, you know, some form of, um, you know, some form of, um, leg power output I think is a really, really valuable [00:34:00] biomarker.
Um, you know, maybe I've never been a fan of, uh, bio impedance measurements, but I just recently saw some studies looking at, uh, bio impedance concur to BMI. And even though electro bio, bio impedance is like not super accurate and there's limitations, it's actually way better than BMI, uh, in some ways, according to, you know, predictive power for, um.
For people mortality, basically, I, I have to go look at the study, but it was done out of somewhere in the US and they were comparing the two and essentially BMI gave them Italy squad. Uh, but the, but the biological impedance, even though it's limited, was actually relatively good and associated with mortality in like the, you know, five to 10 year period after the measurements.
I was like, okay, well, you know, if I was in level three and I didn't have access to my calipers or dexascan, um, yeah, I still wanna know that. Like, I think that's like a really vital foundational piece of information that would be suitable for level three. And, you know, and, and [00:35:00] if not, you know, yeah, maybe we are looking for a DEXA scan or something like that, but like the body comp piece is, is pretty crucial.
Um. Can you send that over to me? Do, do you remember seeing if they, like, what was the demographic and did they control for hydration or anything be before, beforehand, or is it just I think they just, they just stated their limitations and they were like, yeah, it's limited. But I, I, but I'll be honest with you, I haven't looked at it closely.
Yeah. I was just surprised. Like I heard it on Na, you know, nature podcast. Maybe it was, um, like the journal nature, like they have their, their podcast and I, it might've been that, or it might've been something, but it was like they were interviewing the researcher and, and, uh, it's an interesting, because yeah, there's not really been many much research that has shown positive, uh, a positive light on biological impedance, so, no, I know.
Yeah. Yeah, I know. Yeah. [00:36:00] Yeah. So I don't know, uh, if, uh, uh, uh.
Anyways, I I, that just, that just came up recently and so I probably would look into it a little bit, but, um, but I still feel like that there's like, you know, knowing you where you sit in that longitudinally would be pretty, pretty important. Um, I think everything else, level three, like the, the ora ring wrestling heart rate, HRV would be awesome.
Uh, sleep, um, as a kind of a foundational view. Um, so I'd still probably have those domains. Um, I'd still be trying to probably answer the same questions, which is like, kind of like where if I'm gonna sit down and put pen to paper, what. Movements and exercises are, are good, are good fit for your body. Like, that's, that's kind of the primary question I'm trying to answer.
It's like, [00:37:00] what, what movement patterns are gonna be the right ones for you? Uh, when we start to load you up to increase your strength, increase your power, increase your muscle mass, um, you know, are you somebody that likes, you're gonna benefit from honestly being on machines and doing leg extensions and leg curls.
Like there's no, there's no difference between, uh, really at the end of the day between machines and free weights for increasing muscle mass. So if you're, if you're limited, you know who cares? Like if you go to a gym with all machines, all right, great. You know, that's actually another piece of information that I always like to gather as well is like, where are you gonna train, um, in a level three?
Like, what's the environment like? Uh, but I think at the end of the day, you know, the, the main driver would be still the same thing, Naomi. I just would be like probably tearing down considerably. A lot of the more, uh, energy system constructs. Like, I don't think I would be trying to, you know, remotely collect, you know, NAP or training zones and stuff like that.
I [00:38:00] probably would just try to get a sense of what your max heart rate is and then go from there, um, and, and fine tune as we move forward. Um, I, I, and I would probably tear down the, obviously the, you know, the, the in-person piece where we're moving on the track and, you know, it's more fluid and maybe taking a couple hours.
I'd probably have this condensed down into about 30 to 60 minutes. Um, and then that'd be it. Yeah. Nice. I think that's a, a really nice, um, kinda explanation of what you do and I think hopefully will be informative for us in, in terms of what we're trying to build, because I think it's really key what you just said around, um, power.
Like, like power, like trying to understand that. From a digital perspective is, is difficult. Like you've got my jump, it just gives you jump high and you, yes, there are calculations that you can use off it, but I'm a bit skeptical about them. So yeah, trying to, trying to figure that out. Um, [00:39:00] is, is, is gonna be interesting for our level three, but if we talk about kind of the, the assessments that you would implement with a level four, level five, what types of technology and tools would you use for that?
So for example, you mentioned force plates. Are you using force decks, are you using kind of kissler, ec, um, and then what are your, I suppose, key metrics that you are looking at, like from a performance and strategy perspective, and then kind of what's your confidence in those as well? So we're probably trying to get into a bit more detail now about some of those.
Yeah, sure. It's all right. Yeah, yeah, sure. Um, so in, in my setting here, um, we, uh, we've got a MCI plates, uh, plugged into racks and [00:40:00] software where we collect all the data. Uh, but we do all of our analysis in that lab offline with custom built scripts. Um, it really helps us. We build, we build our custom scripts for every, every, uh, every, uh, test that we do, uh, just because, um, I just like to know what's going on behind the hood.
Um, but, you know, balder Hawkins is fine with me. Um, I think both, both, uh, you know, I haven't really gone deep on comparing them. I, I think other people have done that in the literature. Uh, I think Val and Hawkins line up pretty well, uh, with like, not between each other, but like within, um, they line up pretty well.
Um, good people, good companies, um, you know, established, uh, in the, in the industry. Um, I would have confidence involved. Um, no, no, no real concerns. Um, uh, [00:41:00] so, um, uh, obviously, you know, if you're going with like Vault and Hawkins, they're doing the analysis for you. Um, I don't, I I, I found that some of the bigger force plate companies are, like, the way they analyze jumping activities and tasks are not as quite as flexible in, in what they output.
And so, I don't know about, like, I know MCI i's Accu Power software is like, I don't totally know how it works. Never, never really dove into it. Um, I'm sure it's reasonable for certain things, but like. Um, you know, I know Vault spent a lot of time like, you know, quality controlling the, the software for, you know, dummy proofing it essentially.
Um, so yeah. Anyways, I probably would use what I use and run it through my lab, my, my scripts for Walder Hawkins. Um, primary outcome measures are, you know, it's pretty [00:42:00] simple. Like, um, obviously, um, using the, using the, like we use a work energy method, uh, that's kind of how the lens that we apply to, to jumping a lot for performance assessments.
Um, and so, you know, I look at, uh, essentially calculating, uh, jump height off of the takeoff velocity. Um, so we calculate a takeoff loss, a velocity curve. Then the velocity curve is what we use to, uh, determine, um, a lot of our interesting measures, I guess. Uh, so off the velocity of the body center of mass, we picked the velocity of takeoff.
Uh, we picked the max velocity, um, as well. And sometimes we'll take the difference between Vmax and TOB. Um, it's been something that's been used in the aging population quite a bit. Um, there's a tm max do TOBV max TOB ratio or difference, like just how much you drop off in the final tail end of the jump.
Um, we, um, I, I [00:43:00] always put in the, uh, peak external mechanical power, uh, as a, as a value primarily because, uh, we body mass normalize it and fat pre mass normalize it where we can, um, especially if we've got the DEXA scans. Um, and I think that that's actually a much, for me personally, it's a much more informative value to compare between people, um, than, than, uh, jump height.
So if you're a really big human or a really little human or, um, a really heavy human or really light human, um, male individual or female individual, um, you know, if I, if I get a fat free mass normalized or a body mass normalized, uh, peak external mechanical power, you know, kind of like helps me see on the spectrum of like, you know, uh, those values are very familiar to me and they've been used a lot in other studies.
Like, um, I always point to Martin Ballard's study, uh, where he used, um, force plates and in a, in a primate population and compared, uh, like power output of primates to humans. And, you know, jump [00:44:00] height was just not possible when you were looking at a little marmoset jumping on a, on a force plate, uh, to compare to a human.
But he calculated the, you know, the, um, the mean and, and peak external mechanical powers as part of his, uh, of the study, but allows you to kind of see like on the table what that output is. And I think it's a nice way, it's, it's like. It's like less informative from a per sport performance lens, but it's more, more informative to me from a longitudinal mechanical biomarker lens lens.
Um, and then the other thing is, because we're applying a work energy model is I always look at the, um, so, so you got the jump height from takeoff velocity, v max TOV difference, and then we'll look at the breaking power and compulsive power. And so we'll look at the peaks, we'll look at the, uh, mean, uh, across the phase, and then we'll look at the work, um, in both, in both phases and, uh, that's it.
Um, and then I usually graph, uh, graph, uh, force display the loop loop, um, [00:45:00] create a loop and look at like the left and right force production across the range of motion. Um, look for any like bananas, differences side to side that seemed like way outside the normal variability like. Did you like load every single jump with considerably more fraction of the force coming through the right side of your body versus the left.
Um, but that usually comes through in the force displacement loop, uh, which Hawkins generates, by the way, I don't think Vault does that. Um, but it's just gives me a nice picture of what the inter limb asymmetry is, uh, across the range of motion. And, um, yeah, and then, then the contraction time, just how fast the jump was.
Um, that's pretty, pretty, pretty informative and, uh, and, and, and every time, every time we've done any sort of analysis in our lab where we use, like, we'll use a supervised [00:46:00] machine learning to kind of like, um, you know, kinda cluster and understand features that distinguish different groups. It's funny that the, the RSI and modified RSI consistently come back as being, you know, pretty discriminative value.
Um. So I keep it in and I use that. Um, the other one that, uh, would be secondary that sometimes creeps in that seems to have some value is the force at that zero velocity. So essentially like, um, at the very, very bottom of the jump, the peak force at that, at that incident in time. Um, so that, that sometimes shakes down pretty valuably in our models, but I don't, to be honest with you, uh, hinge on it.
Um, I guess what I would say, Naomi, is that like, um, those are my primary force measures, but we've been much more interested in, I've kind of shared a little bit of this on the, on the, [00:47:00] um, chat or Slack channel, but I'm kind of like, I'm kind of more interested, like we kind of think about it a little bit differently and, and maybe, maybe we'll do this for a little bit more and it'll end up being like useless.
Um, but right now. I find it simpler and it's like we, we collect enough normative data, um, and we, um, get enough context and we, um, have our different tasks and we input our different mechanical variables, um, that we have confidence in. 'cause I think that was your question. And, and really at the end of the day, it comes down to like, does it make mechanical sense?
Is it embedded in a, in a kind of a work energy or impulse momentum model? Um, you know, um, is it, uh, is it something that relates ultimately to an aspect of force production that I can think about, [00:48:00] uh, in terms of human movement? I'm like, oh yeah, that relates to this. Like your, your impulse relates to your jump height, your breaking power relates to how fast you drop down and, and how, um, aggressively you, you, you unload towards the earth in a jump.
That, those are the things that to me are, um, I can, I can grasp mechanically. Um, and then the, the, the final piece would be like, it makes mechanical sense, so it's embedded in one of those things. It's got some sort of biological relevance, I guess like, or functional relevance. Um, and, uh, and therefore it's kind of sensitive to something I care about, you know, like, uh, uh, it changes with training or it goes down with injury or it gets better after you rehab and get back towards sport.
And it doesn't in other people. And I mean obviously it would be awesome if it was like, yeah, it actually predicts injury. That would be phenomenal. But, you [00:49:00] know, let's just say that like it's sensitive in some way and I can see that in, in, in a face validity standpoint or when I analyze it. Um, and then the, the final piece would be the repeatability of the measure, which I think at the end of the day, you know, we've just done enough, done this enough that the ones I just described, uh, except for, uh, breaking and propulsive work, depending upon how you analyze it, um, that that can be a little bit noisier.
And in those work loops, sometimes we pick limb stiffness, lower limb stiffness, which is also a little bit noisier. Uh, but the other ones like take off lost ev max. Uh, the, um, the impulses when we're looking at side to side differences in force production, um, the peak external mechanical power and mean power are all, uh, and the breaking powers are all highly repeatable.
So we, uh, I anchored those, uh, to those core ones. Um, uh, but where I was going with this, [00:50:00] uh, Naomi, is it's like, it's kind of like the problem with all this testing is you, you're trying to synthesize it down and you end up interpreting discreet outputs from discreet tests. And it's like trying to like stitch together all these little pieces of the puzzle that like, you know, are describing your performance or your capacity or your movement or whatever, whatever, whatever your health.
Um, and so where I was going with this is we're taking a d different lens on this now with our ACL injured athletes. And what we're doing is, uh, training a model across the tasks. And we're doing that to, um, understand, um, you know. Let's say in our female university athletes, uh, what is a desirable high performing group or subpopulation?[00:51:00]
And then we, um, so we understand that relationship of like what desirable is or what optimal is or what, like the, what is the middle of the group that we think is a good group, I guess you could say. We would call it good. We would say, yeah, that's, that's where we wanna be. Um, and then we train a model that says like, you're in that group or you're not.
And then, um, I take your information off all your testing and I say, what's the probability you're in that group? And it's like, oh, there's like a 90% probability Naomi belongs to the group that we think is good. Um, or there's like a 30% probability what's holding Naomi back? Oh, it's these four things. Then I'm like, okay, cool.
So, um, we're gonna prioritize those four things in your training and see if we can like, push you into the, into the [00:52:00] group that we say is like the group we want to be in. Um, so we've been, we've been starting to like try to move away from the interpretation of single data points and isolated tests and, 'cause it's, it becomes like, you've already identified that.
It's like, it's a lot of information. Um, how do you make a decision off that? And I guess ori you know, initially, like, maybe you like, I don't know, you just like treat everything by itself and it's like, well here's your aerobic power and here's your strength and here's your power, whatever, whatever, whatever.
But what's nice about the more unsupervised machine learning approach in our view is, um, is that it's more like what's the combined weighted characteristics that, um. Are more like a pattern and, and, and we sort of try to capture that combined weighted expression of characteristics for different groups that are likely to be probably a little bit different.
Like if you're a, an elite female basketball player versus like [00:53:00] a speed skater versus like a weekend warrior versus somebody who's like, you know, trying like, you're, like me trying to like, you know, stay healthy across the lifespan. Like there's probably reason that we don't want to just kind of like create arbitrary benchmarks and norms that don't really make sense.
And so, uh, but then you're like, well, should it be, should it be male specific? Should it be, uh, should it be according to, I don't know, like your ethnicity according to your income? Um, a bit of both. Um. Like your level of ability or disability? Um, I don't know. You can start to really think about it. It's like, oh shit, I have no idea.
Like, that's the problem we would be in with, let's say our university setting. It's like, I actually have no idea. Like, should it be a, a field hockey standard? Well, we think the field hockey players are all maybe low [00:54:00] relative to the basketball players. So is it because field hockey players are low in those values or is it because they're sport specific?
I don't know. Maybe they're just low. So we we're trying to, we're trying to probe, uh, opportunities there, Naomi. And I think that's where, uh, getting back down to how we, you know, how we isolate information from tests. Um. It's mechanically relevant, it's biologically relevant and sensitive. It's repeatable.
Um, it's anchored in some law, hopefully of like physics maybe. Um, uh, that's not to exclude other pieces of information. You're like, ah, it's not really anchored in physics, but it seems to tell us a little bit of information. Totally open to that. Um, I'm not opposed to to, to doing that, but I am, I am opposed to a, a random fishing expedition, which is like, well, why do you put that number in?
Oh, I, I like it. It's just like my number that I use. I hate that. So not a fan there. Like, I like to be like, okay, show me why. Like, show me that it's [00:55:00] something like, uh, you know, explain to me why, like, dig a bit more into that. Um, have you thought about repeatability? What is the repeatability? Well, I haven't even looked at it.
Okay, well I don't, I don't buy it. So, you know, I wanna know those kind of three pieces and, um, and then I wanna move beyond trying to interpret all these isolated measures and try to get to a place where. It's not like, oh, you're break. Like I teach this on a force plate. This is why I am telling you all this backstory is, um, when I go and do my in-person clinics with a force plate, and you know, I'm like, Hey, bring up a, a participant.
Have 'em do some jumping. Do it the way you want, hands on your hips, uh, you know, interpret the information. Everyone's like, oh, well this is up and this is down and this is that, and this is that. I'm like, okay, bring 'em back. I'm like, okay. Now do two, two jumps where you go as fast as you can now do two jumps where you dive bomb down to the ground and, and, and create, really create really low positions now.
Uh, do it slowly. Now do [00:56:00] it, uh, now do it with, um, you know, where you kind of like hinge at the hips versus like squat down. And it's like the forced time curves are like impossibly different and hard to interpret because they change, right? And the values all change. And so it's like, which one's? Right?
It's the same person. All I did was coach them a little bit differently. So are you picking up on like biologically relevant information or people who've been coached a certain way? Um, and, and that's always my caveat with trying to interpret these data, and that's why I'm very careful to be like, you don't want to put, you don't want to have so much stuff that you can't explain it.
I want to be able to get a number and be like, oh, oh, I get it. I see the first time curve, I see the number. I'm like, oh, the movement pattern probably looks like this. You know? And then it's like, is that a good movement pattern? Um, yeah. It's awesome for you because you got long legs and you, um, [00:57:00] you know, you're jumping mechanics are just the way they are.
Right. But like, um, the isolated measures are really hard to stitch. So I love the idea of having, like, having like, um, an approach that is curated off some data and where we, we try to put important information in that's tailored. Rooted and then trying to interpret the whole, uh, versus trying to interpret, uh, a whack of isolated measures, which I've always found to be hard.
Um, maybe at the end of the day I kind of do what I just described the machine learning models would do, is like I I take a holistic picture of who you are when I try to get a picture of like, what's the most important thing we do need to do next with training, um, because all this has to go into like a decision.
Mm-hmm. Yeah. I I love that. Um, Matt, I mean, I, I, I already asked you loads of questions on that, on that model, but I think that's definitely something we, we can try and implement that cascade of all the data [00:58:00] we're collecting over time. But with that, I'm just thinking how many times does an athlete have to complete like that kind of set of tests for you to be confident that they are like 90% in this.
In this category of like the basketball players or they're 30% off and these four characteristics, um, or measures of where they need to work on. Like have you done any type of testing on that? Like not yet in terms of confidence? No. So that, yeah, I guess it's like one step. Yeah. Not yet. And, and I mean, obviously those are some important questions.
Like what, what, how does it change? Uh, like, even think, think about just recently even too, Naomi, like with the blood testing, think about, you know, um, and I won't use the name just in, in terms of like using this as like being anonymous. Uh, there was an individual, we did a blood sample. They, uh, the [00:59:00] report came back and it showed they had, uh, elevated liver enzymes.
Um, or there was some indication it was like, oh, there seems to be some sort of liver stress happening. Uh, what could this mean? You know, we, we, you, you run the risk of being like, oh, geez, well maybe there's this, maybe there's that. The individual comes back and has a repeat of the blood work and it's like, um, it's totally, it's totally normal and it's kind of part of the problem with this, right?
It's like you, the more you look for, and the more you gather, the more likely you are to find something that's outta place as a statistical probability. Like that's just, that's just stats. Mm-hmm. If I test a thousand things, you know, uh, statistically a number of those will be positive simply based on the laws of statistics.
It doesn't mean anything. You don't have any symptoms. You're fine. That's why, [01:00:00] that's why when you go to your doctor, I think at the end of the day, they don't, they don't just like start with like testing everything they like. It's a differential, right? It's like based on what you're presenting with, they kind of like go down the, well, hey, maybe we should run that liver test on you because you've got some signs and symptoms of something that could be sinister or whatever.
Right? But I guess what I'm trying to say is, um, with all of these, there's a caveat, which is like, how, how do you then use it? Right? And it's, for me, it's like all of this, Naomi anchors back to a decision I'm going to make when I put pen to paper on like, what training are you going to do and what are you going to do in the, like, it, it, uh, what intervention are we gonna prioritize?
And I am 100% when I get the output, I am then curious about like, why, what, why could this be before I start being like, oh, well of course there's a 10% probability or whatever, you know. No. What I'm [01:01:00] interested in understanding is, um, where are. Where can we nudge you? Right? And, and obviously by virtue of like, you know, prioritizing things a little bit more and having a little bit more, uh, instead of me just sitting down pen to paper and being like, well, you know what I'm really interested in right now, this is always the thing I'm, I would remark on, uh, is what drives people's decisions on how they train is the course they just took on the weekend.
Like off, I'm all over weightlifting right now, you know, I'm all over getting strong. I'm all over getting big. I'm all overly, I'm all over functional. Aldos and uh, you know, freaking bands and cables and like balancing and like doing athletic movements. Uh, I'm all over the bike. It's like, oh, lemme tell you, I give you the bike 'cause it's the best thing ever.
This interval program. Oh, no, no, no. It's zone two work. I'm telling you. I do zone two work and night, so. Awesome. And I think n Naomi, you should do zone two work as well. Like that's, [01:02:00] that's that confirmation bias or that proximity bias in my view. Is 99% of what drives people's decisions on what type of training you should do as a trainer.
And, and we, we anchor back to what we like, what we're interested in, what we feel good about. And I have conversations with you that give you that energy and you're like, I wanna go do that. Like, my trainer said that this was good. And, you know, and, and at the end of the day, I think that's awesome. Like, it's, it's better than nothing.
Like, I mean, at least you're like, you know, at least you do. At least there's something to it. Uh, but, and at the end of the day, let's be honest, like, you know, you probably have four or five paths to roam. Like, it's not just like one way to train, right. Uh, but I guess what I'm trying to paint a picture of is.
If I can gather information, understand you, who you are, and the likelihood that you belong to something that I care about and you care about and understand like where you're strong and where you're weak and what attributes we might be able to address. Um, what's [01:03:00] really cool about it is I don't make any hard and fast decisions that screw you over in terms of your careers.
I'm going to bias a little bit towards and monitor to see if it made it better. And if I get to the end of it and the training hypothesis failed, my hypothesis was that single leg breaking power is really limiting you because of your left ankle mobility and because you, uh, really just need to be stronger.
That's what, that's what my decision is and the data's kind of pointing me towards, and that's what I've sort of synthesized this down to. And you could really benefit from better sleep and better low end zone two recovery work. Okay, well you're still a basketball player. I'm not gonna like take everything out, but I'm gonna bias a little bit more towards those things.
I'm gonna go for six weeks, I'm gonna retest on the things that we're looking at. I'm gonna wonder, ask you, how are you feeling? How are we doing? I feel great, you know, or I feel way off. This isn't working. Okay, cool. I will nudge that along and it just becomes, for me, part of my ongoing process. Um, so how many, I don't know how stable [01:04:00] this might be.
I would expect as with most of these things that there is some variability. Um, because that's just the way it goes. Um, I would expect that if you're mostly on the margin, uh, or off the margin or off the midline, it becomes a little more clear if you're in the gray zone where you're right around it.
Where it's like, it could, could be, I'd have less confidence, you know, if you're grossly off, uh, versus grossly in. Um, it's helpful. Uh, but I think at the end of the day, the ability to like. Create a pattern of people's, uh, testing and like trying to kind of get a picture of who you are, uh, would be super valuable.
And I believe it would be, um, you know, useful providing, we were training people to understand how to create behavior change and contextualize like what the information could mean. And, um, I think that's the back end of this. That, that I'll say that, you know, maybe I'm obscuring your question, which is like, fundamentally like, is this valid?
Is this a valid approach to, to looking at things? [01:05:00] I don't know. Um, but I'm not, I'm not convinced interpreting isolated testing and isolated metrics, is that valid. And I don't want to become the other type of person that exists in my, my, my, my world and your world, which would be somebody who says it's all a bunch of gobbly.
Go, don't even bother. Just like start training, you know, like, we don't need to collect information. Well do your blood testing. That's good enough. Here's a program. Um, you know, um, go do it like that, that, that is a world, a simple world that a lot of people live in. And I think it's a, I think it's also a valid world, like for people who operate that way and some people get a lot of results.
I just think at the end of the day, I gravitate a little bit more towards somebody who likes to understand information in the context of making a decision. And I think that that's better. Uh, it's better for my process, um, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's gonna be better for somebody else's process.
Um, and if I'm somebody who likes the [01:06:00] information and to synthesize it, I think it's better to understand the characteristics and ask the question more question around the lines of, do you belong to a subpopulation that you and I both agree we care about? Do you kind of look like that? And, um, you know, at some point the answer could be like, I think if I was doing this 25 years ago with lot less, uh.
Biomechanical testing and kind of like big blood profiles and all this other stuff, the answer could be a little more simple. Like you might just look at it and be like, well, I can tell. I don't need to do all this testing to know that you don't look like a basketball player. Um, and at the end of the day, who cares?
Do you play well? Yeah, I'm good. I'm, I just don't look like I'm Tom Brady. Right? Tom Brady never looked like, uh, an NFL football player with chisel and fricking, you know, Tom Brady's combine video, if you've ever watched it, is the classic, uh, you know, uh, type two error, right? They call the type two error in sport.
It's like you, you failed to see the difference. You failed you, you failed. The, the [01:07:00] person, um, is like, uh, excluded when they should have been included, you know? And, uh, you failed to detect the, the, the, the, the, the, the true, the true signal that guy is running. He's got like zero, zero definition. Runs like a lumberjack.
Um, but he had tenacity. He could throw a ball. He was super accurate and he was like the hardest working person on the planet. And if you just base that on physiology and biomechanics, you would've liked, you would've missed that. So the point is, we, we are using this to build context and to build, to build models of understanding, in my view.
And, and I think at the end of the day, that's just a super important piece of the puzzle for, for interpretability. Um, and so I don't, I wanna be very careful in saying like, when I look at these sort of comprehensive characteristics, I'm really trying to be careful about it so that it like, comes into training, [01:08:00] comes into like who you are, what do we have opportunities, and, and you know, that's why it's like the opportunity card, right?
It's like, where's the opportunity and do you agree that we wanna do this together? Okay, cool. Let's try. Perfect training hypothesis. I'll put pen to paper, paper to change those things. 'cause I think these things will help you. You agree that we'll do this, um, and we'll have a chance to see if we, if we achieve it, and if the answer is at the back end, you know what?
Dang we, we did all this work for six weeks and we're no better. Uh uh. So, okay. Uh, either I'm a bad coach, uh, I didn't communicate what you needed to do, you didn't really hear what I said, and maybe you missed a part. And, uh, maybe there's something on your end that you're like not quite doing the way you need to, or maybe it's the wrong stuff and we agree on that and we fine tune that as we move forward together in a relationship.
Right? So I think that's the, that's how I output this info tactically. And I would hope that our cascade coaches are [01:09:00] like very similarly now in the conversation, which is where tram and behavior change and all these things come in. So it's like, how do I use this information to like. Maybe a little bit better decision, but like also to create opportunities for the company to be like, oh, you know, this person, Lisa looked a lot like Naomi.
They have shared, they share characteristics. Uh, you know what, it's not that Naomi didn't belong to that group. Naomi's her own group. Oh, I get it. Naomi was never supposed to be in this group because Naomi's got her own group, which are these characteristics. Ah, perfect. Now we know Lisa kind of belongs to the Naomi group and now we've got a new group to work with.
Like, that's, that's how I think that this becomes useful. Um, so. Hopefully that's some context on that. Um, yeah. Yeah, I think that's great context. Um, Matt, I've just seen the time. I know you've got a, you've gotta run, I have some follow up questions on [01:10:00] that, but let's, let's put a pin in it 'cause I know you've gotta a, you've gotta go off.
Yes. And, uh, yeah, let, let's do a, a part two if that's all right with you and, uh, a hundred percent, yeah. Yeah. Next week is jammed for me because I've got four master's thesis defenses. I've got two for my own student.
