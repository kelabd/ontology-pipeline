Ontology Knowledge Capture - Damien_Naomi - 2025_08_06 17_00 BST – Recording
[00:00:00] Okay. So just for the purpose of the recording, um, we can start the interview transcript from here. Okay. So first question will be, what are your primary areas of expertise or focus, Damien? Um, I mean, it's quite extensive over time, you know, so, but I would say, you know, principally I was educated as a physiotherapist.
Um, over the last 30 years I've been a, a physio, uh. On top of that, through the nature of looking at [00:01:00] sport and performance, um, extended to, uh, better understand strength and conditioning and athlete development and athlete performance, um, as an integration to practice and experience and working at higher levels of sport and with sport athletes.
Um, and so yeah, I would say principally probably injury management and recovery. Um, return to performance, return to sport, um, athlete development, athlete optimization, uh, and then a fair bit of work with integrative teams. Um. Consulting. So blending in with existing teams and empowering their current environment, um, to [00:02:00] have influence, impact, or change within that athlete, but within the environment that they have.
Um, I haven't principally led a sport or a team. I have, I guess in the Olympic and national team since, um, been an IST lead or support or on site for those. But I haven't had a kind of, uh, day-to-day seasonal structure like with A NBA or NHL or or MLS team where I've been, uh, principally central to their.
Uh, to their performance plan and, and work. So that hasn't been a role I've taken on. I've always acted and been engaged more as a consultant and more on individual and athlete projects, um, and then re reintegrating them back into their performance environment and [00:03:00] what they have. Okay, great. Um, so our next question is, and you've worked with a lot of different sports, so how does sport type influence your assessment or intervention choice?
So what we're really looking for here in terms of, of your answer and your experiences, the sport, um, the different types of assessments and interventions, um, and the differences between those. So, you know, would one sport be very different to another sport in terms of your, your choices based on your experience?
Yeah. Um. What I would wanna highlight here out of this and, and, 'cause I reflected on this a little bit, um, and even just from our conversation this morning with our ISD team, um, I think probably some of my biggest lessons and some of my biggest learnings and some of our work into [00:04:00] this process of, of how, and I'm not sure exactly how we're going to capture this.
You know, I think there are great people on our team for the metrics and, and for, you know, what, what's our specific assessment, what's our, you know, average output on a basketball player versus a hockey player. Um, there's a lot of, you know, sort of connections and, and points on that. And, and I would integrate and back that expertise in terms of, of, of what Matt Jordan's gonna analyze and put out.
And I would, you know, add or contribute to that versus lead that, but. What I feel when I come into this, if I was to take what I think is one of the most important things and one of the most important lessons that I have, because I have worked in a huge diversity of sport, a huge diversity of personalities in terms of an athlete that's a skateboarder versus an NHL player, a NBA [00:05:00] player versus a snowboarder, a snowboarder versus a beach volleyball player.
Um, and, and the environments that, that they're around, the people that are around them are always so diverse and different, and I think that that's one of the things that is going to be a real opportunity for us to spend more time in and around because ultimately where and what I think is the most important regardless of sport, is connection and trust.
And I think that's both in high performance teams. I think that's in integrating into performance environments, into data, why we collect the data, what we do with it, how it informs our processes and, and progresses still comes down to trust from the athlete. Um, and I think really what we've got a better nail is, is how are [00:06:00] we building trust and how are we building connection?
And so as you come across the difference of sports, so I come into a ton of environments and I'll apply into a place and don't necessarily even know, like I'll know the sport, but I may not, I'll know roughly the history, but I don't necessarily go in looking for a metric. What we go in for is a significantly longer conversation to start to understand.
What's been done, what's been effective? What's the nature of the athlete? Are they a structure based athlete? Are they a chaos based athlete? Are they, uh, mature? Are they immature? Uh, uh, do they have buy-in? Do they not have buy-in? Are they suspicious, are they not? And so, regardless of ultimately, like if I came in and had a standardized assessment to, oh, here's my volleyball assessment, or here's my snowboarding assessment, you know, like even [00:07:00] Matt had me in on a project and I, I, I went down and it had had a long rehab and process and they were struggling and they were at a hump and I flew down, honestly, not knowing necessarily what we would come in and do.
And it really wasn't ultimately about an objective test or a metric. You know, you could put it as an injury and you could put it as a sport. Ultimately it was identifying the individual, the team, the strengths they had, the opportunities that they had, what had been done, what hadn't been done, what was the mental connection behind where the athlete was, their frustrations, their family environment, their struggle.
Like so much of that is so much more important than saying this was a hockey player and or here was my standardized assessment as a consultant within that environment. And so I think this is a really hard thing and I know it's not really answering your [00:08:00] question per se. Um, and I'm probably off on a long tangent that you're probably trying to bring me back to your interview process.
Um, but I would say that I think it's probably the most important thing, and I think it's one of the strongest. Things that I have is, there's awesome sports scientists that will tell you the metrics and I will tell you the strategy I have towards changing those metrics. And as they provide them or, or we deal with, the more we highlight that there's a issue with their eccentric load absorption, great.
What, what's the nature of what we're gonna train in that when we highlight that as a problem? And I think that that's certainly something that we can look at and do, but ultimately part of my ability to even come into Cascade for an example is, is I have established levels of trust with the practitioners in the background that started it.
If I was just to come into even this process new, I would say there was [00:09:00] probably, you know, there's certainly a lot more opportunities to build out. Really points of connection and understanding of the scope and the web of who we are and what we're doing and how, how our culture is. And, and, and I think this is what we're trying to get to and build is, is how are we intaking athletes and how are we intaking practitioners and how are we building a team of practitioners that really are aligned in their understanding?
And, and therefore then how is that, how are we understanding of the athlete's objectives and how are we ultimately supporting that? So I really think that there's a big first step on integrative teams and building trust and connection with the athlete. And so when I go into a sport, that's the first thing.
It's not the sport. [00:10:00] Now the second thing is understanding. The demands of the sport and the nature of it. You know, is it an endurance-based sport? Is it sprint? What's, what do you, what do you need to do in that? Like a bobsledder, you've got a five second start with over speed downhill. Um, a skeleton athlete has to run in a bent over position with one arm that doesn't cycle, and they have to basically, you know, control eccentric forces and not slow down into that first corner.
So there, but I'll also more often than not get with a technical coach to assure that A, ultimately my understanding makes sense. And B, their coach's view aligns with objectives. Um, and then I'm providing and generating solutions that ultimately hopefully makes them a better coachable, engaged athlete to enhance those [00:11:00] objectives.
And that's really. Regardless of the sport is, is where these things go. Now that's, there's a context of whether it's a post-op, ACL, which is gonna have certain structure in the first three months or four months. That's gonna be different than an ankle surgery. And the extent of that I've seen, um, but even each of those pathologies is different, right?
So you can have an ACL repair or you can have, like, I've literally had a skier that had from one injury that had A-A-C-L-P-C-L tear. So complete ACL tear, complete PCL tear, MCL tear, uh, both cartilages damage and patella tendon torn off the bone. So that all was a scope of that, that repair. Now that's an extreme case, but you know, one ACL.
Can have, uh, you know, posterior corner, it can have meniscal [00:12:00] damage, it can have accessory ligament damage. So I think again, like there's a, a real diversity in where we end up depending on injured nature medical. So yeah, what do we do is we check through what's the pathology? What's our extent or ex expectation of regional healing?
How does that fit into then their movement patterns and their strategies? How does that fit into their base trainable qualities? How does that fit into their performance objective? Whether it's returning, whether it's surpassing or growing, whether it's enhancing. How does that fit into who they are? How are we gonna coach that individual that they can meet us?
'cause you can give them the best metrics and the best program to change. That metric. And ultimately, if they don't adhere to it because it doesn't fit their [00:13:00] nature of how you're going to engage with them, then they end up feeling like they're failing and you're, you're breaking down around that. So, so that, and then ultimately then, does it link into coaching objectives?
Does it link into performance development? And how do we enhance, and does it link ultimately then into resiliency? Robustness and an enhanced athlete that's returning back, ideally elevated from what they've come from, more robust grown in their understanding, integrated in their objectives and move forward.
So, long answer to probably, maybe not even the question, but um, but I do think that there is a massive first step on trust, connectivity, and alignment. Brilliant. I think we had about three or four golden nuggets in there, Damien. So took that off for the, for the interview. You, you actually answered a couple of my follow up questions, um, within that as well.
And yeah, that's, um, it's [00:14:00] more than just the sport. Um, which a hundred, a hundred percent and it's, and, and, and even more, it's, it's more than just the metrics and, and, and I get that we're a metric based and a data based company, but to have success, there has to be that real point of connection to why the individual's doing it.
And sometimes it's, and, and the associated mental aspects that go along with that. Do they lack confidence? Are, do they have fear? Are like, do they need more nurturing? Do they need more structure? Do they need. More of somebody in, in their corner and support, they need to understand the data. Do they not need the data?
And that we can collect it in the background, but we can discuss and develop the behaviors and the connection points. But this is where I think the, you know, if, if you ask me where or why do I think I've been successful in the diversity that I've had, like I, [00:15:00] I don't, I'll, I'll get dropped in at the top end of a lot of sports with the top, top end performers.
And ultimately what you have to do as you come into that is you don't necessarily have the opportunity of a systematic process. You've gotta build those points of connection, understanding, and and engagement around who they are, what you're gonna do, what's the timeframe you have. To make changes. What's manageable in that, that you can outline a pathway to success and or what's your, you know, definitive advice based on experience of whether or not you think that's realistic or not realistic, and what do you create alignment in the objectives or changes of that timeline?
Um, so I think that, I think those things are, are super important as, as you, as you come in is, is how we ultimately capture how [00:16:00] the relationships start. And I think we got at that today in this meeting. That's part of what I partly brought forward is, you know, uh, output of, uh, you know, friend of mine, uh, who I do a, a fair bit of work with Dr.
Ben Spore has written a book on, on, on output and, and how that aligns to outcome, right? You're more in control of your output, your, and, and ultimately what I brought up from that purpose mapping was. You know, if the athlete's buying into the purpose, if you understand them better as a whole, then you can identify those critical success factors to that purpose.
And, and I think we have to be really careful in the generalization of those purposes to where it's like, oh, I want to score a number of goals. I want to, you know, it's like, okay, what, what's controllable? What can you do? Everybody wants to win, right? Nobody comes in and says, oh, like I wanna win a gold medal.
Great. So does everybody in the field. So where are your opportunities? [00:17:00] What do you truly commit to? And if you're saying you truly to commit to that, what are the critical success factors to that objective? If you're going to adhere to those and deliver on those critical success factors, what are the behaviors that are required?
And those are things you can be accountable to. So I can tell you, I wanna lose 10 pounds for the summer. I can say that all I want, what do I need to do? What do I need to change? How do I need to act? And if I do those things, I'll produce that change. But otherwise, if I don't ultimately, like what's driving me to that 10 pound change?
Do, is it strong enough? Is my commitment strong enough? Am I accountable to that? If I'm doing all of those things, then it's our job to have the expertise to get you there, right? And whether that's supplementation, [00:18:00] nutrition, energy system development, you know, uh, strength work to build metabolic change, like we can provide that expertise.
But you have to buy in. We need to understand. We need to understand you. I could develop a program to lose 10 pounds from somebody from a distance. It could be an amazing program, but that person's not willing within or not able within the busyness of their life to do all of the things I've outlined.
And now it's just gonna fall flat because the metrics aren't ultimately Matt, because they were too much. And maybe it's gotta be a 12 week journey rather than a eight week journey. And maybe it's, as I said before, on some of these other health seekers, it's like create consistency in the behaviors, then you can layer on more work or higher level work.
And I think sometimes what we get with the objectives is we get too focused on the number [00:19:00] and we outlined something to make change in that, and the individual hasn't done the actions to have that impact. So again, um, we'll, let's, we'll, I'll let you move through your process. No, that, that, that's, that's good, Damien.
I think, um, I mean, it's something that we've discussed before, is we need to map, um, behavior change and habits onto anything within, within the ontology. So any type of intervention or, you know, anything, any goals that an athlete or health seeker has, there has to be behaviors and habits, understanding what they currently are and what they need to do to change, but any, any type of intervention that we provide.
So, um, it's really good context to have your point of view on that as well as we build in. And that will hopefully all be captured, um, by our pipeline, um, as well. But yeah, and I think secondly to that is, is there's always a challenge in taking athletes out [00:20:00] and being a consultative body. Um. And then there's a reality of their team environment as well.
And, and how they get placed back into that. How they get re-engaged in that, how we're supportive of that or not supportive of that and how we empower or engage in those relationships is also really important. And um, and I think sometimes those dialogues can go on the objective metrics of a counter movement jump and how are we obtaining an improvement, you know, in their watts per kilogram or their peak power or, um, you know, their rate of force production.
Um, we can be aligned in that, in our language to the team and therefore we're building that trust and that empowerment and that continuation on, but it's really like figuring out the way that we are empowering the environment they're in or engaging or, or not because that environment isn't [00:21:00] supportive of it.
So maybe we only have. This window and then they're going to ultimately be in that. 'cause we don't have an avenue in or we don't have a connection in. And again, I think it's just better lines of communication and clarity to both the athlete and, and the environment and the understanding of impact that we can have or not have based on the window of time.
We have the nature of where they're coming from, what their environment's like. And some environments are super open and engaging and some are closed off. It's just the reality of, and we'll create frustration if we're trying to say we're going to do in season support and we're not connected. And they're not connected and, and there's not enough delivery of our, our ability to actually have influence.
So I think how, how we outline and how we engage into these relationships would be probably the, the, the, the key thing that I would highlight from the range of experience that I've had, I've had challenging situations I've had. Really [00:22:00] difficult ones. I've had ones that have gone well, I've had ones that have gone poorly.
Um, so I think that really, that's gonna be key. And I think it still reflects into what our link to the health seekers as a, as a whole are. But yeah, if I, if I took this interview, which I have done in a direction, it, it's to, it's to
start better, um, or, or start with more. Engagement on the opportunity of, of a, not just what we're presenting, but why we're doing it, how, how that links in, what the expectations are. Um, and then also even as we sort of onboard new team members in like how do we get them engaged in understanding the culture of what we're doing and the excitement and really kind of, you know, how and, and what we're building in these high performance teams.
'cause you know, there, there's a lot out there on leadership and high performance teams and I think those metrics are, are really important. [00:23:00] Yeah, definitely. I, I definitely agree. Um, agree with a lot that I think our processes and procedures going forward are gonna be super important when we scale and we get more and more practitioners on board.
And you have more diversity of mind. Yeah. Um, servicing our, our athletes and Yeah, to your point, like relationship building relationships are. Super important with the athlete and the support team, especially in our environment where a lot of it is remote based support. So, um, I think this has been great context to, to start the interview for sure.
Um, I'm probably gonna bring it back in. Okay. Yeah. To be more specific, just the nature of this, we have to try and kind of go, it's an unnatural way to go one by one 'cause everything is, is very much linked. Um, but it's probably the most efficient way for us to collect some of this information. Um, but feel free to digress.
I will, I'll just bring you back Damien, if I need to. Sure. So, [00:24:00] um, what we'll probably do next is move on to, um, and you mentioned kind of at the start around your domain expertise and there was a, there was a, there was a long list, um, which is pretty cool. So we can focus on one of those and I'll leave the choice of, of which one up to you, but.
It'd be good to understand, um, for that domain, whether it is like return to performance as an example, what are the kind of key capabilities or characteristics that you are trying to understand, um, within that domain? Um, so what we're looking for there is really like construct names and, and sort of descriptions.
So if, uh, an athlete or a health seeker comes to you, let's say if we are talking about return to performance with an injury, you've diagnosed it, what, what are your next steps in terms of those characteristics you're trying to [00:25:00] measure, understand, and what assessments would you use to try and understand those?
Um. Sure. Uh, let me think. I mean, if we take, let's take a, a little bit more com complicated one that's pretty common and pretty big in sport, which would be hip and groin. Mm-hmm. Right. I think we have a lot on knee and ACL. We have less on hip and groin. Probably probably have less again, on foot and ankle.
Um, and then we have shoulders more significant with throwing sports, but also significant with trauma based sports. Right. Um, so if we took hip and groin, so the challenge with hip and groin is that you have, it's a, it's a, a clinical triad of, [00:26:00] um, of assessment, diagnostics, and function. And so, because unlike the knee, which has a better association with injury and post diagnostics, so I was skiing, I felt the edge, catch and pull away.
I felt a pop and my knee gave way. I had a follow up MRI, um, and it showed my ACL tear and the compound damage with it. Um, the hip and groin, they have pain that may or may not influence performance. When they do the diagnostics, within the diagnostic testing, you have X-rays and you have MRIs and MRIs. Um, but there's a very high instance of abnormal findings on non-pathological or non-res presenting [00:27:00] symptomatic patients.
So it's very, there's, there's a number of different studies, but there's, there's high instance of labral tears, cam deformities, more so than probably pincers, um, but bone related changes and or labral damage, but non-symptomatic hips. So now you have a symptomatic hip or groin tissue. You get the MR MRI or MRA done, and you tend to have those findings on top.
And so then the question often with it, is it surgical or is it not surgical? And so, um. The, and again, this comes down to both health seekers and um, uh, health seekers and athletes. If you talk to the surgeons, um, which I deal with a fair few of them, [00:28:00] often they'll look at the x-rays as being almost more informative because they can see the bone changes, which they know they will have a more direct impact and influence on.
So they know they can shave down and change the bone. Um, the labrum, they, they would repair. The problem is, is it's a massive surgery. Their ideal demographics sort of 14 to 44, um, and non degenerative. So if their degenerative changes in that hip, the surgery is more difficult in terms of the recovery.
And or the outcome from it. Um. And it's a hard procedure to do. Like a knee's pretty accessible. The hip is not accessible, and the nature of surgery to get into the joint is difficult. So they have to put them under massive traction. They need to get into the joint capsule, they need to open the capsule, they need to get into [00:29:00] the labrum, and there's no, there's a ton of traction based force.
So they need to open that up under mass traction at the legs to get a little space to get their bur in and shaved down and titch. Then they need to titch the capsule. Then they need to repair if there's muscle or incision. And so the outcome is, is that it's quite discomforting post-surgery and takes a period of time to get through that phase to then actually build them back through.
And then ultimately you have to retrain all of. The dysfunction around that and associated. And then often, let's say if we take it from an athlete standpoint, they've had longer histories of pain that they've been playing through that's been inhibitory, makes changes to the muscles that are deepen around that joint.
Um, sometimes you get fatty infiltration, you'll get change in the actual nature of the, the control of it. And now you've increased the amount of range it needs to control because you've increased mobility, you have more pain [00:30:00] inhibition around there, you have more weakness around, you have more range to work through and you've gotta develop back through this whole system.
So it's a long system of, of recovery. So there's a big decision making question mark on even whether or not surgeries of events. So our ultimate tests are rely on clinical and they might be looking at the hip power and comparing abduction, abduction open, uh. Open or bridged long leg fleas. Um, joint range of motion and mobility.
So how clean is their motion? How much internal rotation do they have? How much external rotation, both in terms of at uh, 90 degrees and at a neutral or extended. Um, how much extension do they have at the joint? Um, what are their then integrated function in terms of power [00:31:00] output with jumps? Can they jump?
Can they not jump? Are they too painful to jump? Um, can we look at that from, uh, a squat jump or a counter movement jump? Can we look at their balance? Can we look at their integration? Another big area of integration that I think is underdone is head and vestibular, ocular. And balance and connection with that.
So, you know, when they, uh, walk tandem and move their head side to side, are they really poor at their awareness in, in their joint positioning and control of, so, and then we'll look at their movement strategies. So if they're a stop start sport, how do they do it? How do they decelerate and re-accelerate?
Um, how many times then we start to get into the sport itself? So how many times are they doing this in a game? Um, what are the G forces on them? If we look from sort of plana data, if we look at just, [00:32:00] um, you know, even catapult that, you know, you're gonna have your, your background of their sport demands.
How many kilometers are they running? How many high incidents of speed or high, high velocity output. So ultimately that's what we have to match back to if we're gonna get 'em back. But we look for what are the opportunities and often. The opportunities of poor movement strategies will go hand in hand with tissue load.
And so can we improve their, their manageability of their forces, improve their warmup and activation, and improve their strength and control and balance around that to whereby that pathological present presentation may not be a disruptor to function over time and that we actually don't need the surgery and that we can enhance their functioning and performance without that.
So [00:33:00] there's kind of a long list out of there, but ultimately, if we looked at a health secret, it's a little different than a performance athlete. Because a health seeker, if they go and see, generally a surgeon would say, I want you to have done a high quality conservative rehab management of this for 12 weeks and see if we can make change.
Because the output of doing the surgery is going to be a, a real challenge. It builds again, behaviors. In that 12 weeks people will have said, oh, I've gone to physio. But unless you really break down what was physio, um, or I failed physio, I did that, it still hurts. It's not better. Well, did you really do anything that would influence.
The titch, was it consistent enough? Was it heavy enough? Was it within the ranges? Um, what ranges do you need for your sport if you're a runner or a triathlete versus a soccer player or a basketball player, um, or a wrestler or something. So all of those things will compound to present your clinical picture.
Now you're putting [00:34:00] that into function. Are they able to perform that function and have you really, again, I think it's the interview process of what have you really done? And it's kind of like, oh, I had PRP, but one PRP is a lot different than another PRP. And I think physio and these things are the same.
It's like, oh, I've got hip pain. Uh, it clicks a bit. Um, I've had an MRI and it's got these changes. I probably need the surgery. It's like, well, what have you really done? Did you have those changes? We often don't evaluate the other side. If you did the diagnostics on that, it may have the same findings. Um, so what I think partly the, the evaluations, what have you done to date, really, you know, versus just, oh, I've done physio, or I've done soft tissue work, or I've done strength training and it's, it hasn't worked.
If they've done a really good program and it's influencing function to where they can't do the activities they want to do, and they've got a relatively clean [00:35:00] joint and they've got findings, they become a great candidate for it, then we start to build up the pre-surgery plan, which would again still be building their functional awareness of movement.
Control and how they absorb, load and produce power. What are our windows to make change from squat to split squat to single leg to single leg concentric versus single leg eccentric. So I would take that, usually look at that paradigm, um, and I would build out the capacity in those phases, even simultaneous to different levels or exposure or ranges or, or, or nature of what I want to change in and around that.
Um, and, and now in preparation for surgery at the pro level and the athlete level, the athlete has to really have enough autonomy and and environment to say, I don't want to do a surgery around that. I wanna manage this conservatively because at the pro level, it's easier to do something than [00:36:00] nothing. If you blow an off season window on conservative management and they still need the surgery, there's more frustration in or around, so it's almost an easier environment for them if they have the surgery.
It's easier for a team to say, you've got your six months off until you're recovered and ready to return to play, versus we're gonna give you four months to work at this conservatively, see how it responds, and then hopefully not need a surgery that we might still need in now November. And now you're blown for the, for the season and it could have been addressed, you could have been back for December.
So it's, it's, it's easier at the pro level to almost do something. I think that when we come into Athletes with Pathology, this is a similar process that we work through, is. What is the nature of the regional breakdown? How sensitive is it? How much can you load it or not load it? What are your strategies for it to develop stress tolerance?
How does that fit into [00:37:00] its acceleration or deceleration? What can we measure in that? So if we're doing force plate testing, we can do a squat, jump, a counter movement, jump, a single leg jump, a repeated hop test, we can look at those metrics. Um, and then any associative normative data of a NCAA player, uh, an NHL player, anything that we can collect on, you know, where they've had measurement of their in sport demands and performance.
And then we link those things together in our objective metrics and we determine what's trainable and changeable. And then what do we think we have to do to make those changes, and how do we outline structure to that? Great. Yeah, that was again, a comprehensive answer. I think we could go four different directions, um, based off that.
So you almost sort of described from a health seeker perspective your kind of pre-surgery interventions and [00:38:00] assessments, post post-surgery interventions. And then from, for an athlete perspective, more often than not it's gonna be surgery due to not wanting to waste time in, in the nature of the, the environment.
Um, but there is that opportunity where the athlete can advocate for themselves in terms of non-surgical, um, interventions. So I think, um, we'll start with if we go for. An athlete track. Mm-hmm. To begin with, we'll circle back to health seekers. Um, you mentioned quite a lot of, uh, of assessments there, which is great.
So, you know, starting off with kind of your imaging x-rays, MRI, um, did you say MRA as well? Yeah, it's, uh, there's just a dye in that and it gives a, it's sometimes a little more definitive around the labral damage. Mm-hmm. Or the labral tearing. Um, so there's an intraarticular dye that's associated with the MRI.[00:39:00]
Um, so it will give a, a little bit more of an extensive picture on the labrum. Brilliant. Yeah. So again, that's all information that we wanna collect, um, within the ontology. Uh, but you mentioned then some sort of performance assessments, so force play assessments, um, range of motion assessments. So it would be great if we can go through those in a bit of detail.
So kind of for each of those types of assessments we have. Some detailed questions around them. So for like the force plate assessments as an example, um, what technology or tools do you use? Are you using valid force deck, you using, um, vertek or kiler force plates as an example? Um, and then for those assessments, like what are the key kind of steps, uh, protocols that you use, um, and then the key metrics that you would or would not use coming out of that.
So [00:40:00] there's a lot of questions there, but we're trying to get to kind of the granular detail of those assessments linked to, um, pre-surgery function and post-surgery when you would implement those types of assessments. Yeah. So, um, uh, how to put this together so. Yeah, so if we look, if we're, if we're still around the hip, um, again, I think it depends on the level of the pain coming in, in terms of what we're gonna get for output.
So, um, I would do a joint evaluation to determine what I think their current envelope of capacity is, what, you know, what is the range available. Because a lot of these athletes have very, like, I'll have athletes that say they have tight hips and they've got a ton of range. And I'll have athletes that are like, oh, I'm pretty good today.
And they have like a hardware limitation of [00:41:00] the amount of range because the hip lays bone in, in your developmental period that's non yielding. So you know, if you have bony changes, you have structural change. So I think around the hip we need to understand. What we think first and foremost are the structural nature of what the capacity or capability is or isn't.
That doesn't mean it has pain or doesn't have pain. It doesn't mean it needs to be changed immediately, but we need to then look at how that relates back. So first off, we have to understand the joint ranges, the mobility and their compound. Um, like regional. Capacity. Right? So that's flexion, extension, internal rotation, external rotation in different positions.
They combine to a fattier flexion adduction, internal rotation where we look for clicking or catching. We look at how much available. A lot, a lot of athletes don't like that. Flexion [00:42:00] adduction and internal rotation. Uh, we'll look at Faber, which is flexion abduction and external rotation. Uh, and we'll look at the quality of that.
We can measure that where it drops to the ground, but I wouldn't say it's particularly accurate. I don't think a lot of our joint range of motions are particularly accurate if, if we thought about pest and retest. Um, so I think we have a sense of, for me. What's the envelope that that athlete presents with?
How does that compare Left? Right. They can still have bony anomalies left, right? Um, but like you could use, you can use, I'll use an easy angle, which is an electronic range of motion. Um, uh, sensor you'd sets to zero. You just put it kind of on the limb. It gives you a number of their internal rotation. You hit zero, their external rotation.
So you've got a scope at, at 90 of their ranges. Um, but again, [00:43:00] how that's if, especially if it's manual goniometry, I think it's really tough to be consistent and to be like, oh, today it's two degrees better, or four degrees better, like our degrees of change. So I think, is it pain producing? Is it significantly limited?
Would the range available impact their function? Or their solutions. So for example, and that can be positional. Um, so you have a hockey defender, they've gotta skate, pivot, keep their chest forward to a player, move with a player close space and accelerate in different directions. Whereas a hockey goal tender, there's, there's a massive number of them with hip issues.
Um, because the most now effective technique for them to stop the puck and to drive across the net is called the reverse vh. And so there's a, there's a specific [00:44:00] strategy on how they need to place. They place one skate against the post that knee lies on the ground. So you can imagine now the angle of the chest, that knee lies on the ground essentially.
So that's the lower part. Now the upper body has to come up high to cover the near post. The skates on that post, but the shoulders to that post, they have to square up to the shooter or the play, and then the other pad stacks more vertically in this direction. And so they have to be able to come actually into abduction at that hip, massive internal rotation while they're forced against the pole, and then come up high to cover this corner.
And then that's what they then push with their power. Because now the pup moves so fast and the releases are so fast that if they don't have that push off the post, it's very difficult for them to get across the net. So a performance objective. Is that, that is the structural position that they play in, which is [00:45:00] massively, and again, I think there will be something that comes in over time around the developmental load on these goalies if they're being taught this at early ages.
Because once that bone forms in, that bone is there. Um, and that's now you need to understand that you're not just coming back from that surgery, but you're coming back to that reverse VH style in the most demanding performance environment with the speed and the play of the puck. So it's very difficult for goalies to get back into that.
So ultimately understanding the nature of the sport demand goes hand in hand with understanding A, what is their current capacity. And so if you don't have that range on your right hip, you are going to get it somewhere else. You're gonna peel at that labrum to try to get it. You are going to get more load into the SI joint and through your back you're gonna get more stress at the knee or the ankle.
'cause you still have to stop the. So ultimately you've gotta cover that post. Um, so understanding the [00:46:00] mechanics of what they need to do, and then the function of how that leads in. So I need to know the range of motion, the capability of the joint and the structure. Then I know how it performs under function.
Then I can look at its strength using, um, vault force frame. You can put that in different positions of open chain internal rotation at a 90 degree angle. You can do it with a long leg straight. You can do a long leg squeeze test, you can do a crook bridge, squeeze test and opening test. Um, you can look at that at outer range more so than inner range or neutral range.
Um, you can use a handheld dynamometer. I think it's a little less effective 'cause it's reliant. I think there's more user error in it. Um, and even the force frame has potential for user error compared to even like a chain attached to the wall. And a load cell. We'll often give you a little bit more fixed if [00:47:00] we look at knee extension versus the force frame knee extension.
So if I'm looking at quads and hamstrings, it's a little bit of differential positioning. It's not as good as the lab in Calgary where you've got a structured set environment. But the reality is, is most clinical and performance environments don't have a structured chair or now the ISO connect testing.
So you have to use what you have and recognize that it's got some error to it. Um, and so it will give you a good conversation in terms of what your objectives are. Um, and it will give you some, a line in the sand of where they're at and a potentially changeable line in the sand. But you're looking at, yeah, you're fourth generation in those different positions.
And then what, what can we change in that and what can we improve in that? The left right, I think is a little bit when they do it in a fixed [00:48:00] where you're using both at the same time, I think you tend to default. A little more. I don't think it shows up your asymmetries as much because I think you default a little bit to the weaker side and you end up more even in what that force is versus actually being like, oh, I pushed really hard out here and I didn't push as hard on that one side.
But I think when you isolate that, it's a little harder to do it. Um, on the, on the one side, we do play with that though, um, where they will do it one legged at a time. So force outputs, uh, in the varying positions, again, you could document which positions you used and why and how it relates to what sport.
Um, you could have a standardized one, but again, it would be challenging 'cause a defenseman will never go into that reverse VH position unless they've fallen in a scrum in the crease, right? And a foot's been pinned for a moment under somebody and someone's pushed you back. But it's gonna be a one-off incident versus a performance.
[00:49:00] Um, if they're a change in direction sport. So we've looked at that. Then we would look at, um, yes, vault. I use vault with the four decks. And so they're jumps. Um, so squat, jump counter, movement, jump, uh, single leg jump. Recognizing that, again, I think there's a fair bit of error to that, but I will just look at what can they, I'll use it as a test of balance and coordination and output as much as I will critically assess their, their, their concentric power.
Um, because I think it's a combination of trust. Do I believe in this leg? Am I gonna put the force through it? Do I have a coordinated upper body strategy? Did I load into it? Well, am I balanced in what I'm producing? So I'll use it, but I don't. I'll look at the objective numbers of watts per kilogram [00:50:00] jump, height, um, rate of rate of force development, reactive.
Um, but I will be less structured in that because I think that like I'll be more structured in a counter movement jump with hands on hips and hands-on hips with their, um, uh, would like their squat jump when I do the single leg jumps. And again, I know more often than not, like Matt would put hands-on hips and make it more about the lower body and trying to focus on that.
I think there is a lot of. Error in our ability to test. But I'll look at it often with just letting them do whatever they wanna do with their arms and balance and looking at it almost as a coordination test and what their output is on that side versus the other side. And I think it's pretty telling, um, especially late stage or as you're moving through with these younger development athletes from soccer players that are 15, [00:51:00] 16 years old, they don't have a ton of structured testing in their background.
So it's really what can you put out and balance, um, on that limb versus the other limb. And it can be a real kind of line in the sand of how big a differentiator is. I can't get any force, I don't feel like I get any height. I barely get off the ground on this side versus the other side. Like they'll see it a little bit more and we'll have an objective number to all of those things.
But I recognize that it's not a standardized lab based test. And I, and I would say that, that, I think that's important.
For me in particular and for clinicians. So depending on who we're talking to and what their environment is and what their athlete access is, makes this very different. Um, so if I have a young 16, 17-year-old, we diverted here to [00:52:00] ACL for the moment, but knee ACL, there's a ton of them in soccer. They don't have a huge training volume or history in the background.
My testing with them is even when I have the access to it, is opportunistic in and of the times that I choose to do it. They may have more fatigue in them. They may not, it's like they don't have an accountability to necessarily what their weeks really looked like. When we check it from one week to another week.
They might've had two workouts the day before. They might have had an exam, they might have slept, they might not have, they might have already had a practice or they ran around or they came and we did a training session. We tested them at the end to look at a little bit how they did with fatigue on them.
Um, so we're not like, we have to be honest that we're not consistent in the variables of testing. And so really it becomes a line to your overall, you'll see big trends on that minimal difference change. Like a, you're coming along a lot better, or B you're [00:53:00] not. But I think the metrics are really looking at, Hey, where were you at?
And now a little bit what, like how do we document a bit of what that week was? Or are they tired coming into testing? Are they feeling fresh? Um, but it's not like a team environment where you're gonna test them all on Monday. Everybody's had the same sort of Monday load, they've all had a similar type week.
And so from a clinical aspect, you may not have the same nature and level of control. Their, their actual kind of engagement might be based on their resources on how often they're coming in. They might be in once a week, they might be in twice a week, they might be in three times a week. It's, you know, it's different than again, a player's off season where they're fully engaged in.
So I think as we deal with health seekers or developmental athletes. We need to use these things, but maybe we need a little bit of, Hey, what's the environment of, of how you're coming into when you're doing this test? How much have you done these tests before? Because you [00:54:00] can improve significantly from the fact that this is, you're better at jumping, uh, you're less nervous about the test.
Um, I'll have athletes where, you know, they know they're left sided, uh, asymmetry on their landings, and now all of a sudden they're really right sided just because they're so, like, they're mentally putting themselves way more over there. It shows they have the capability to do it. So there's an improvement in it, but you have only got a snapshot.
So I think when we're using these objective metrics, we need to be a little better aware of the environment of how we're using them versus saying we're making these changes, um, or that these metrics are important. It's like these metrics are important. If we actually have the monitoring on them, the structural plan of when we test them, they're coming in with a day rest and we're testing them first thing in the morning.
But the reality is I'll see them at six o'clock at night on a [00:55:00] Monday, one week on a Wednesday, another week on a, you know, they had a tournament that week. So maybe we don't test like, so I think again, metrics or outlines are one thing, but we have to be cognizant of health seekers, developmental athletes, private practice, and what it entails.
And professional environments, or university environments. 'cause I think they're all very different. And even university would be different than professional. If you had school exams, stress, sleep, you know, and you don't have, I'm traveling from venue to venue with the team. Sorry. No, no, that was good. You, you answered a lot of my follow up questions.
What, one of my immediate question was gonna be like, how does the health seek or the athletes kind of current state influence your interpretation of the assessment? And you, you've kind of answered that a little bit there, but, um, so what I'm, what I'm kind of hearing from that is, is it's not just about the metrics.
You need the context around it. So do you, in [00:56:00] the assessments that you, that you do, do you place more emphasis on kind of assessing like the movement capability in the kind of whole of the health secret athlete rather than specifically on just what the metric says? Yeah. Um, and then are you comparing, are you comparing externally to kind of the population norm or are you just looking at kind of, um, within health seeker, so kind of pre post, that sort of thing.
Yeah, I think that that's, that's exactly it. And, and I think it's partly my age, right? Uh, in that, you know, when we, when I came up through, I mean, there was very little educational in sport and performance and, and, and I think that that became something that I became more known for and better at over time was breaking down performance into movement strategies, influencing those strategies, coaching those strategies, and reintegrating them back into performance and, you know, and whether that was with the [00:57:00] athlete and or with the coach and or, you know, post rehab, you know, I think that was, and we didn't have those tests.
We didn't have testing, we didn't have objective metrics. So you had to build an athlete based on your impression of where they were and who they were and what they were doing. And so you looked for what your opportunities to build what you felt was a sport. Performance model over time, you got more and more testing.
And then there was different tools and they became more accurate, but they were relatively inaccessible. So they were in a university lab, they weren't in a clinic. They weren't like, I think we're far more educated now and we're getting there and you're going to see a massive uptick of more technology into clinical spaces.
And Matt and I were even chatting about this. It's like, but there's still, and I would say even to myself, there's still a, yeah, I've done this, but what do I do now? And I think part of that is what was the context of what you did it in? [00:58:00] So I think there almost needs to be a bit of a pre-survey that somebody's doing, Hey, I'm fresh today, we're doing it at nine in the morning.
Or it's the end of a workday. I'm tired. Um, I've had a tough weekend and we're doing this test. Cool. Like it's, 'cause I think, I think a little bit of that is important. Um, and I think as we start to get the metrics, there's more and more opportunity for education in and of them. Um, and I think that that's something that, you know, I always value the conversations with Matt or other people, sports scientists of that nature.
'cause that's who I'll reflect back to. It's like, you know, what do you think of this? What do you think we need to change? You know, what, where are we going? Um, I think that's really important. Uh, and then I think as we, you know, as we expand those and make changes, [00:59:00] then we need to better understand the mean of what they're returning to and or what their grouping is like in terms of, you know, what type of athlete are they?
And that might be even more important than sport, but understanding. Yes, what the nature extent of the sport or their, their mean. There's a cool thing on Velda, or at least I've talked to them. I know that this is kind of coming out, but again, you get these percentiles and I think that that's neat. And so if you've entered their age and their sport, you've got a global kind of base that they're percentiles are starting to come out with.
And so you're now starting to see, yes, you did a, you know, your watts per kilogram on this jump was actually a 70th percentile of what you've entered for age and sport across kind of the globe. Or it's at, you know, like it's at 20%. It's like, okay, that this athlete needs to do more. So I think as, as data provides insight [01:00:00] and context, it becomes more powerful a hundred percent.
But then we have to be, did we collect it? Well? And I think that's a challenge clinically. So I would always say that I use these things as. For me as almost my education, my accountability and my engagement with the client, like it builds again, I think it further builds the conversation, the connection and the opportunity and when they're like, Hey, can I do this?
Can I do that? Let's have a look at how you're changing and what you've been doing and, and it gives you a little bit of, of that. But I'm always in the background aware that I am not a lab, I'm not publishing this, it is not publishable in terms of how and what we're using. And so I think we have to be really cognizant of that as we're building our process out is if you send an athlete to me to be tested for their knee versus you send them to [01:01:00] MAT to be tested in Calgary for their knee, or I guess even in a better scenario is if I have an athlete that I'm working with and they're a 16-year-old soccer player in high school, and then I'm trying to compare that my tests.
Metrics to Matt's test and metrics where they've flown in, they're then rested coming into it. Their day work is to just do that test. They're met in the morning, they warm up really well, and they do that test. I don't know that those are comparable as much, and, and I, so I'm not sure what the answer is on that, but I do think that versus just saying, Hey, we, we've got these, these metrics.
I think that's where things like Plana become really interesting because what you're doing now is you're just putting them in and getting information on their real world environment of what their week looks like on load, what each day looks like on load. [01:02:00] And we can, at the same point, do a repetitive, similar test to do your one minute or two minute run, do a walk test, do five consecutive jumps, and then do your training session.
So do your normal warmup. Then we'll have a pause. Then we'll have your run then, or we'll do your run first and your jumps. Then you'll do your warmup in your session, like however you wanna structure it. But now you have consistency of data points through the week in their environment, and whether it's on the floor, on the field, in the dressing room before they go out on ice or whatever it might be like.
I think this is where there's, if, if it's accurate, which it's getting better and better, it's dashboard is getting better and better. It's reporting. Our understanding of it needs to continue to grow. But that's what I really like about it, is it's not, Hey, when you get done, your practice come in, we'll do your test and we'll determine how you are doing and progressing.
It gives you a lot more real [01:03:00] world insight that you can better manage. I think. I really value, I haven't, I, I'm still learning and using and working and we're integrating it in with our processes, but I think that's the exciting thing about it. I think, you know, it doesn't give you as clear a picture necessarily as the jump test, but now you have a little bit more in conjunction with, of athlete load through the week and that can drive a further, deeper conversation.
Um, 'cause that's what we've had with a bunch, and that's one of our biggest advantages, distal, elite or distant from distance is you are telling me you are doing a low load day and it's just as high as your high load day. Your tell. Like, like I think that that's where we, we can have a lot more influence of what we're doing because we can get objective nature to that distance based information versus if we say, okay, go and.
[01:04:00] See your physio and do your jump test and send us the data and we'll determine if you need to do more training or or so forth. I think there are scenarios where sometimes you can still pick off low hanging fruit that you're doing all of the movement strategies and you're doing them really well, but you're fundamentally significantly weaker or you are influenced by an injection or inflammation and that's producing a specific weakness that you can't manage regardless of how well you move.
So I do think we can pick off some of these lower opportunities based on like an objective difference that regardless of if like. If I beautifully push a bobsled with excellent starting position, I won't push it very fast. Like I don't have enough strength and power to manage getting it off with any time.
I could look great doing it, but I just don't have enough thickness in my system. And I will break down going down the track [01:05:00] a couple times 'cause I don't have enough resiliency in my system. So how we look is important, but it goes hand in hand with then how we layer that compendium of function, diagnostics, clinical, and objectives of performance.
Yeah, I, I absolutely agree with the, I think plana is, is really cool in that you're not just looking at a snapshot or a window of time with someone you're actually monitoring, you know, those different changes in what they're doing in their real life. Um, but I think it goes, it goes back to your point of like, of context.
And I think, um, to your point earlier about, you know, if you were doing a test in Matt's lab compared to your lab, I think we need to capture that in our, in our processes or in our ontology. So whether that is, um, like a self-report something or we know that. If they're gonna be doing certain types of assessments in your lab, it's gonna be different.
The procedures are gonna be different. You are more [01:06:00] focused potentially on kind of movement assessment rather than the actual metrics themselves. And someone else might be more standardized on the metrics. I think that's really key, um, for us going forwards with our health seekers and athletes is we need to, we need to be confident if we are gonna use that data on what, how it's been collected and if we should be using it again for certain reasons.
So I think that's an important point for us to, to follow up on. Um. Well, I think that the, and, and or you know, what the structure is of, of where somebody's testing, what the, you know, like, uh, you know, and that's what we did essentially with, with AZ was, you know, she would come up. We would look at sort of the pathology and health of the joint.
We would look, Carl and I would work together on, uh, the foundation and the training. We would both worked on the, on the coordination of movement [01:07:00] and strategies and, and load absorption. And then we would send her to Calgary for standardized testing. That was the same. So it wasn't even like it came in, it was the same as the same process.
We knew it was repeatable and then it, and then our informed information was, yeah, we're not yet there on eccentric force absorption. How does that affect an impact? Our programming? It doesn't move like a spring yet. It doesn't push through its terminal extension. When it laterally pushes, that then went hand in hand.
With those objective consistent snapshot measures. Um, and then we had plana as now also your sessional load is not high enough and therefore at the end we need to add 15 minutes of conditioning with onco shooting to your workouts. Or we need to back that up on Thursday. 'cause we've actually had three really [01:08:00] high load days.
So it gave us a window to develop her onco energy systems and fitness that linked with her skill sessions, which were really important to her. Then we had her movement strategies, load absorption, power production, jumping within a clinical setting of the gym track, med ball work, dynamic loading core link and, and coordination proximal strategies for pushing and receiving and accepting load change in direction movement from split stance work to single leg work.
Then that was also anchored in a really consistent like scientific test environment. Um, so whereas we could have shortcut that and been like, well, let's just do testing on my force plates when, when they're here, and it's not that that can't be done, it just depends on [01:09:00] the relative importance of that and that athlete.
And if it's really important, then we may need to make sure it's. Consistently standardized. If, if it's not, then maybe, or if it is, then maybe we need a video of it being done at the same time so that ultimately we can say, oh, I liked that, or, I didn't like that. And then we got the raw data, right? So we got the raw data, we can object, but we have the video image of it being tested and done.
And we actually, you know, we watched it and actually the instructions were poor and they weren't hands on hips like they're supposed to be. Or they did a 22nd repeat test with a jump or, you know, 20 repeat jumps every four seconds like Matt likes to do. But when we watched the video, they didn't gas it, you know, like they dogged it on the first kind of five.
Um, and therefore we didn't really actually end up with the assessment that we wanted. So I think there's gonna have to be, like, Matt's gonna kind of have to head the objective body of it. And then [01:10:00] ultimately, as we have it done in different centers, we're gonna kind of need the video. Like we're gonna need a little bit of.
You know, a couple of key, describe your week coming in. Describe your time of when it's tested. You know, had you eaten, had you not eaten? Um, so were you fueled, what was your, what was the preparation pre-test like, and then a video of the test so that we're actually now we can start to hang our hat on those numbers and on those changes.
But I think otherwise we're going to, you know, I think, I think, you know, like Matt and Nate can certainly identify key metrics they look at and we can identify, and I think this is something we can and need to do in our coursework. Is when we see these type of patterns, what is the nature of the type of training adaptations we need to make in order to enhance and change these numbers?
And sometimes it can [01:11:00] be, uh, you know, what does it need to create hypertrophy or an increased cross-sectional area, but it also might be how does it integrate into their change in direction? Like you can reproduce that part of it good, but then it doesn't actually look like it works well in their system.
Um, because maybe they create rigidity and stiffness, they're afraid to actually load into it. So in a test environment, they're doing it and then you throw them a ball and have them change direction and they aren't doing it. Um, so I think how, you know. These things are coming in the future with Markerless, um, recordings and, you know, end does work out of avatar is looking at change in direction and we're seeing what sort of strategies tend to load the hip and groin more.
Um, if they're externally rotated, if they're reached out outside of their center, if they don't actually absorb force and they kind of skidder along the ground. So we can start to identify kind of maybe, you know, five [01:12:00] key things with change in direction that we might watch for. Right? If we go back to our original topic, which was the hip and groin, um, you know, we can start, we can identify some of the key things that we might watch for that we see that link to potential pathology.
What becomes really powerful is if we have another athlete, and again, 'cause we're within the cascade system, we can talk about it. But if we have another athlete and they had pathology, which we had initially coming out of the season around hip and groin. We a had to manage the sensitization really strictly of that in the recovery window that we had.
We got through that. We desensitized that. We gradually built capacity back into it, and then we looked at the movement strategies that facilitated that. As we worked through those, we found that those went hand in hand with performance development and objectives. And then our language switched from injury management to an athlete that had incredible explosive power but [01:13:00] didn't have the brakes and suspension to deal with that.
That then led at a higher pace to one gear of, of running at, at super high, a lack of gearing. A lack of absorption, which changed posture, which drops the head, which means you're not reading defense and position as much. And so the whole thing became about being able to. Read and see defense to make decisions, to have gearing and to have the brakes and suspension to support it.
So we end up with a bought in athlete because it's not just about my, my groin and hip don't hurt anymore, but now I'm working towards being better. And what we ended up with was an athlete that played every game of the season, was not limited from any game of the season, from the hip and groin. So had resiliency through the whole season.
Had a couple of knocks on other things that just happened to happen in the season with contact or or outside [01:14:00] incidents. Um, but nothing in the hip and groin flared up for the whole year and was markedly better in his ability to manage the game, to start to deliver, to have options. You know, the coaching staff said he looked more in control again, and it all came down to also being able to.
Stop break and keep your head up and keep your eyes scanning and your vision and your balance in those positions to be explosive again into the next opportunity. Versus chasing yourself down and still being able to make a decision mid opportunity. So the ability to assess movement, to link it to pathology, and even more importantly, to bridge it to performance that becomes really, really special and really empowered and engaged to the athlete to where now you have buy-in to what you're delivering is about, not about injury management.
The, the, the, the tone and the conversation changes. You can have an athlete that just comes into the system, and again, their objectives might be to have a better first step [01:15:00] acceleration and to be more in control of my body posture when I, when I'm stopping or changing, or to be better on defense. And you're gonna end up in the same realm that that assessment's gonna lead to that same picture.
You know, what are your strategies when you. You know, jump and do a lunge jump switch fast and repeat and stop and hold it. What does it do when you run in and stop in that position? What happens when you single leg land and change direction into the next foot? And, and do you have what's happening to your core and your control?
So, but those are really hard to consistently identify. They're coachable and they're integratable. They take a lot more time to change into performance and to be repeatable under pressure because we default to what we tend to do. Mm-hmm. So, but that's where the, if the buy-in is then and the connection is in, then that athlete is, is now in and it's like the next off [01:16:00] season's even better than the previous one, the next off season.
'cause the coaching part of it's done, the buy-in is there now it's about developing the skills and strategy and that's what you see out of these things. And that's where our long term impact and success will come from, is. Good or great athletes wanna believe they've got it as soon as you've told them something.
But the reality is to get it entrenched, ingrained, autonomous, and there when they need it under pressure, is really hard and takes a lot of reps of time. Um, so I think that that's part of our window of opportunity and ultimately our, our responsibility or engagement in education. Yeah, that, that was super insightful, Damien.
I think that's, that's actually really important to try and capture as well. Like, I know we were, I was trying to kind of speak in isolation about some of those things, but yeah, we're [01:17:00] aware they're all kind of linked and you know, if you are, if you've just got one aim, it might then lead to that performance improvement and you can change the narrative.
Of the story itself for that athlete. And I think that that's really important when you're bringing in behaviors and habits into everything. So I think, yeah, from this, from this conversation, it's really kind of shined through around building those relationships and behavior. And it's not necessarily just about looking at the objective metric in itself.
Um, we, we've got to half six or whatever time is where you are, Damien, we've got, we've got to the end and I feel like we've got so much more to, to speak about. We didn't get onto the, the interventions for that. I didn't really get you into anything, but, um, maybe I got you. You did. You, you'll test the pipeline on the background on the back end, which will be good for us.
I think the other thing is that, um, uh, I don't yet have, this is what I don't think we have yet, is, [01:18:00] um, is to this date a great way to objectify movement. Strategies and change. So we can identify isolated, really controlled movements, but we don't have, and even from Plana, we're seeing an outcome versus a strategy.
And, and so how, like there again, these motion capture systems, again, this is where, and I'll be really interested as these expand and as they improve to, to where, where do we become that we can actually hang our hat on the pattern that we think is actually creating load and stress and change that changes that we believe we're making.
Are they making them? Is that integrating it? Like for example, we talk about like, don't reach with your leg outside of your center. The risk of ACL is up, you know, with, with these well. Great until you're in the context [01:19:00] of actually on field and playing and a def defense and somebody's coming at you and you've gotta get out to a ball and you'll do it a thousand, a hundred times in a game.
Now if you happen to then re-tear your ACL and that's caught on camera, it'll be like, oh, that's classic. You know, they reached out. But the reality is they may have, that may have been the one time they did it in a reaction base that was unexpected. It may have been that we thought we developed this strategy into them and ultimately they just play the game, the way they play the game.
Um, and, and they might do it in the gym, and I've seen this even with this other athlete is, is we've had to really build in and, and sometimes it'll come into one pattern and lessen another pattern. So, you know, they'll understand it. They're really good at it. In the gym, I, I remember I had a rugby girl, she had a low back chronic pain and we've done.
I could coach her a hip hinge. I could coach her squat. We could coach squat and hip hinge under [01:20:00] load. We could swing a kettlebell. She could flip a viper tube, she could squat it, integrate, but she could flip a viper tube with momentum, catch it, squat it, come down. And I was like, great. I was like, show me what it looks like when you come into like a scrum.
And she immediately drops into the pattern that she goes into and loads into that. And so her understanding of transfer into their environment was absent, even though she was great at it. But then she had a skill that she wanted to do and lost it, and the integration of that changed. Some athletes do it really well and some don't, and it's the same with performance.
Like you can, you know, you can be talking about how somebody starts or accelerates or changes direction. You end up just, especially on these knife edge sports, you end up saying the same thing over and over and over again and they'll be like, how was that one, let me see it, let me see it on video. And it's like, it's the same thing.
And, and so you'll see like all but the ones that do get it in and integrated in, it's super cool. And you'll see it and you'll see it in [01:21:00] performance. And then they'll do it under, let's say, decelerating in a split stance. They're super good and they can change direction and balance on that backing up.
They're not as good with how they back up. Uh, even if they're backing up to create space for an offensive maneuver, then they're a little bit more out of balance or they collapse into to what they collapse into. So how do you get that back into them? Now you can start to be a little more selective around that position, but there's no great way to objectively measure that yet.
Yeah, that I've seen I down to like a, a bit of skill acquisition as well, I guess apply it in that environment a hundred percent. And I think that's the other thing we have to go into is these discussions around what is skill acquisition and what does it take, how many repeats, repetitions, coach's eye habits that you've got to go for.
And then is it still there under pressure? Right? Yeah. 'cause performance under pressure is a whole different realm, right? Like when I believe I have to do something, I tend to revert back to what I [01:22:00] habitually think is going to be good. So I like the best golfers in the world still have a golf coach with them at every event through all the days and out on the range with them.
And they're feeding it. They're the, they're a far better player than the coach, you know? But the coach is there to keep them accountable to the changes they're trying to make and keep them accountable to that process in pressure and under environments and to stay with it. And when it derails, how do they self correct and how do they self correct that through four days in a row?
Like they're there each day with them. Like it's like, and it's the context of you have all the time in the world you're gonna stand there, line up, look at what you want to do, you decide when you make the swing. The ball's lying there and it's the most technically coached and repetitively coached to make change, but we don't tend to put that into a basketball changing direction, basketball player, changing direction.
We don't be like, I better have my coach on, you know, watching each change of [01:23:00] direction, you know, through my three game window so that it doesn't, I don't default and lose what we tended to work on. So it's, it's a really interesting, again, different sports have really different natures around it. Um, you know, like skateboarders are gonna be a whole different kettle of fish, you know, like compared to what a, you know, beach volleyball athlete gets off the plane and goes to the gym and stretches out and does their push jump measures for their velocity and their height, and then does a workout and then has a good sleep and rests the skateboarder, gets off the plane and goes and skates an area and goes for dinner somewhere and meets the locals.
Like, it's a completely different nature of what you're dealing with. So again, I think you just have to. Adapting around, but, but I would say, you know, that's, we tried that human track, it seemed like it was pretty limited in what its scope of it only gave like a linear, straight on direction. It didn't give any side information.
It was really structured in the couple of things you could do with it. You would [01:24:00] then have to send that to an environment to have it set up and done. So it's going to error that and, and that is the problem at the minute with, with markly tech, um, with movement analysis is you have to set it up specifically, right.
The, like the camera needs to be front on all the movement needs to be in that one plane. Yeah. Of like not seeing anything 3D um, but at the same time you can't just take an athlete to a, to a lab. So yeah, there's, there's some advance in technology. Um, before I joined Cascade, I spent a couple of months, um, actually working in a biomechanics lab.
Um. Up at Manchester Met and there's like a, there's a new IMU type technology, which is trying to do something similar. Um, so we were validating that, and I'd be interested to see kind of how that gets on, like they've just launched, because that's something where we need that lab to the field and exactly what you're saying there.
And in terms of, I think it all links in, like, [01:25:00] skill acquisition is massive. Like you can tell, you can train an athlete to do a certain movement like a million times in training, but when it comes to like, you know, the last minute of stoppage time, like in a football match and like, that's it. They have to, they need to score to win and they, yeah, that movement pattern just regresses, you know?
Yeah. It's, it's almost like safety regress back to that point. So actually having something that can quantify that movement in those environments, I think it's really, it, it's gonna be like the golden nugget whenever it comes. But at the minute, for me, Markus. Wireless technology is not that, it's just people overly on it.
I think too much at this point. And it's not at the point where you can use it and be a hundred percent confident because there's, you have to be trained to be able to use it properly and it's not realistic to those environments. So, um, the one, the one other point I do wanna make before I forget, sort to kind of jump in, but I think the other thing that's really important too is, and I'll say this to athletes, is we're training you with a [01:26:00] strategy that you might want to employ that we think will overall reduce the stress and load on the knee or the hip or the low back or the SI joint.
And so that, you know, maybe 70% of the time when you are at lower speed, you are doing that, you've got options, you've got a, you've got an option that will reduce your overall stress and volume. We would like to see that option, have availability at high speed because that's really important that you get better at high speed management of it.
But also we have to be fully aware that sport. Has a massive strategy of how you're gonna deal with things at all different types of time. So there's gonna be a huge variability in what you do out there, because you're gonna be up, down, tackled, pushed down, battling, fighting through. My son did a lot of wrestling.
Like if I was to say, you need to stay in a position as you wrestle, it's not going to happen. So we need a resilience and a robustness through an extensive pattern. [01:27:00] Then we need the kinesthetic awareness to be able to unload and load, um, so that we have an option and a toolbox that has more strategies for the body to employ or employ.
And then we have the ability to. Deal with a diversity of shit that's gonna happen. And, and through a context of huge rock, like a goalie needs to stop a puck. It doesn't matter whether or not he does it pretty or not pretty. So, so I think it's really important too that as we deal with this, we want movement strategies, we want best practices, we want to build the toolbox.
We then need to build under like graduating that exposure under load, under a variety and variability of range and context and chaos. And then we also need to be more confident with introducing risk in earlier stages to develop an athlete's confidence to risk [01:28:00] management and a resiliency to that. So I don't wanna also get over over.
That we're selling. We need to change your strategy and that has to change into your field of play at all times. But what we want is to change your toolbox and to overall reduce your stress, to enhance your envelope of capacity and capability to better deal with those times that you bump up above what your NA natural management is.
And that we've strengthened you through those as well. So we're not putting you in a box, it's just whether or not you have proprioceptive, proprioceptive ability to move in and out of it, whether you have the muscle control around that, and then whether you have the strength through length and variability and extensibility that your sport's gonna require.
And a triathlete's gonna be different than a wrestler or a lacrosse player or a foot football player [01:29:00] that's having collisions and impact. So just I do want that kind of in this train of thought. That we can also be too micro in what our strategies are, and we need to be macro in what the demands on that athlete are and that we want to enhance their toolbox.
But I would love a better way to objectify their understanding. What I believe I'm changing, whether or not I'm changing that with any consistency when they actually pick up their sport utensil. You know, like I find this fascinating. Worked with a young field hockey player. We were looking at hip stuff.
It's the only sport that I can think of offhand, and I've thought about this quite a bit, that dictates handedness. Mm. You only have right-handed sticks. Yeah. And the length of them is fairly minimal in their change. You have a shorter stick and a slightly longer stick, but they're not really sized to the developmental athlete.
I'm sure the pro models have have more variability and more built in, but you're like, you're [01:30:00] almost sized to your sport and you're told you're going to be right-hand. I can't think of another sport that dictates handedness. Yeah, yeah, that's a good point. I never really thought about it before with, with hockey, because I am right-handed, so Yeah.
So it's natural to you. Yeah, but there's no option. Like you can play tennis left-handed, you can throw, you can bat, you can, you can get left-handed curved hockey sticks. You can volleyball spike with your left hand. You know, you can be a left-handed hitter, you can be ambidextrous in it, but you always have the option to your sport.
Like again, you'd be a water polo player and throw left and right. Um, you can run down, you can push on different sides of a sled. Um, you can snowboard forward or backwards. Um, you know. That's gonna be a challenge. Now I'm gonna be thinking about that over the next couple of days if there's another sporting example.
But yeah, that's, if you think, if you can think, I honestly can't, like, I can't think of another sport offhand that says [01:31:00] you, like I know that it's been culturally that like there was a Japanese left-handed tennis player and they, you know, aesthetically changed her to right-handed, but it, like the racket still would've worked both ways and many players still play.
So, but I can't think of another where the instrument dictates how you use it. Yeah, I can't off the top of my head, but challenge accepted Damien. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can flip it back to me. So I don't know what you got from this. I know we didn't really end, I read your questions. I know we didn't really end up, but I think again probably where my level of influence on Cascade and the structure is more that 30,000 foot.
Oversight down, you will find the micromanagers of your data points and your context and your change. I think where I see my role and opportunity in this ecosystem is learn lessons from those environments and integrative [01:32:00] environments and, and, and integrative teams and challenges and, you know, sort of how we're putting it in a context, um, and how we're then delivering experience to those health seekers or to those athletes that we get that real buy-in.
And, and I would say that's probably, again, along the lines of my biggest strength. And even if you, you know, talk back to that popup, it was like, I didn't know anybody coming in, but you have a short window of time to make an impact and an impression, and you could have either just run through. Here's the standardized testing and there's no real debrief or down brief, or you could make a connection with each person in some sense that they walked away from like an excitement moving forward, that there was an opportunity for them to improve.
And I think that's, I know that we're looking at scaling bigger and that we want to be data driven and we want to be objective and we wanna be consistent. [01:33:00] But how, how we build from that to that point of connection that people are excited and engaged is how we will retain that customer and client and relationship and partnership.
So I would say like this, I love having these conversations because it's like, it's challenging a little bit the norm of what you've put out. To think bigger and broader and how all of those questions ultimately fit into the experience. And again, I think you'll find, you know, you'll have a different conversation with Nate and Matt and, and like they will account to and be far better than me with the data and the points and the comparatives and the metrics.
I would say my strength is, yeah, around that kind of integrative aspect of ideally how we're trying to build success. Yeah. And, and that's been great Damien. I think the [01:34:00] point of this is, is to be challenged because like, I've just made it and I'm one person. If I had all the answers, then we wouldn't need anyone else on the team.
So, um, yeah, like diversity of thought is important. So yeah, I think it's been really valuable. Even if we, we didn't stick to the whole structure of the, of the guide or any of it golden nuggets in there. Um. I think a actually to your point around kind of assessing kind of, um, movement might pick your brain about, um, something as well, we're trying to develop like just like a cascade movement screen for like, um, our virtual assessment.
And it'd be good to get your thoughts on, you know, what type of movements we should put in there. So it'd essentially be like, you know, the health seeker just filming themselves doing a movement and then are like QB or coach or whoever can just assess that movement because yeah, there's gonna [01:35:00] be some health seekers that, you know, maybe are like level threes.
They're not level four, level five, so they're not gonna go to a clinic or practitioner. Yeah. So we need like a low resource alternative to the kind of range of motion tests that you mentioned there with like. Easy angle and things like that. But yeah, I dunno like whether you've got time in the next kind of eight minutes to share your thoughts or if you've got time.
Yeah, yeah, we can. Two things I'll, two things is, is initially I looked at, uh, at your sort of the objective screen and again, it was just kind of pulled together by somebody and it was really kind of great cook influenced FMS influenced. And I think, and I really challenged it because I was like, I don't think you have from this any inter tester reliability, you know, like to try to scale somebody.
I think it was zero to. To three or four, [01:36:00] um, and then establish their nature of dysfunction based on that. Like, I don't know that you would have an agreement between me and somebody doing it and somebody else doing it and, and somebody. So I simplified it down from a screen process to, to saying, Hey, listen, these are the ranges you wanna look at.
Does it produce pain or not? That's easy. Everybody can probably agree like, this is painful, this is not. Um, I. Once we start saying, this is 110, did I really stabilize this? Was I really good at whether or not I have any internal rotation at that 90 degree? Or did I get it because I did this and somebody did that and somebody else didn't do that?
And so the range wasn't necessarily repeatable and even the same person redoing it may or may not be accurate, but to level the amount they tried to initially kind of establish, I think, you know, the, the nature or two levels of dysfunction. [01:37:00] So really, was it, you know, A, was it painful? B, did it look limited?
You know, like is it, you know, if you're comparing left to right or are both sides markedly limited? Uh, and then C, was it relatively good? You know, like basically a three scale thing. And then what you would do is, does this need further evaluation and investigation? What are the cautionary exercises that may go hand in hand with, if this is painful, I can then think about what exercises I'm giving, and in the meantime, what evaluations do we, now we need an evaluation versus a screen, and I think differentiating our system being a screen, now we need to send you to a practitioner.
We need to get a download of their report and their information. Maybe we need to get diagnostics, then we need to build out your program and process. But if, if I'm gonna hang my hat on this being, you know, that it's [01:38:00] 35 degrees of internal rotation versus 30 on this side, you know, like we're gonna be hard pressed to be consistent and repeatable.
So a, does my head hurt? Do I produce pain? Or do I just feel tension? Mm-hmm. Does it move less than it does to the other side? How big a concern is that? Does that go hand in hand with pins and needles on that same side? Um, I need to probably get that addressed to some dysfunction. So I think it's a really important to differentiate screening versus evaluation, and that if we try to do both of those well from a distance based, we're gonna struggle.
So I think we need to, from a distance base, have a methodology for screening to identify areas of priority that need a more in-depth evaluation and information back on how we're gonna deal with that. Yeah. And, and so. Probably that's [01:39:00] gonna go a little bit hand in hand with movement. We're gonna have base movements.
Let's watch you squat, let's watch you lunge, let's watch what happens with speed. Let's watch you one footed. Let's watch you drop and land. You know? And then, but again, I think we need to even evaluate that in that function. Does that, you know, we needed to determine is, is somebody then safe to do those jumps?
So depending on their history coming in, how do we flag the ones that are safe to do single leg jumping or not? You know? So if somebody's had a long history of a knee, um, and or, you know, weakness and inhibition and we're asking you to one legged drop off a step and they collapse on it, you know, we've got a bit of a bigger problem.
So I think we have to build out our screening process and kind of if Yes, do this. Yeah. If no test stops and we build the base 'cause we've got enough information on what we need to start with. Mm-hmm. So [01:40:00] kind of that flow diagram down that you're going through, you know, uh, bilateral pattern split squat pattern, adding speed.
Or, or load, but adding speed, then getting into single leg slow, then determining if we're at single leg speed, right? Um, so I think there has to be a little bit of a way that we're determining where that stop point is as well in that objective evaluation. I think that's a great call out. So essentially a decision tree, really build that.
Um, yeah, no, that, that's really great insight within, within five minutes, Damien. I like that, um, those initial questions as well. I think because we want this to be accessible for kind of all of our health seekers, like regardless of their ability. So yeah, decision tree would make sense because then you are, you are limiting what we're asking some of them to do based off their kind of ability level.
Um. Just really similar [01:41:00] to like all, all the performance, the baseline performance assessments that we're trying to build out, um, at the minute. Like we've got our, you know, like elite athlete level ones, but we also need like your health seeker who can't run or, you know, can kind of walk to the, to the end of the street.
And then after that they're a bit breathless. So trying to navigate that I think is, um, is a good, and even have they done these things before? So I've seen some executive athletes that are really focused on cycling and, you know, these are the newer sports that are, you know, golf used to be kind of more the executive meeting place.
And now you've got athletes, you know, executive athletes out on cycling tours and they're getting keen on their numbers and their power metrics and their training thresholds and their, you know, and they're getting right into it. But they don't necessarily have a large sport volume of history, of training, and so a lot of them don't necessarily, or some of them don't necessarily have great single leg coordination.
So [01:42:00] like single leg jumping is not an easy task for them. They don't jump and land and manage that real well. And if you add pain in the background to that, you could add a bit of a bit of issue. So just even their experience with the nature of what you're asking now, again, it can be a real informative, objective change and improvement for, you know, somebody who, it can become a coordination task versus a power output and that it could be part of their warmup to do little hops and some BOGOs and starting to do some drop in stops with two legs and split stamp and starting to do some single, like building that confidence and capacity, but just being realistic of what do they need to do?
What's their history, what's their medical history in the background? Again, I saw a couple of people in that popup that just didn't have a training volume behind them or had a medical condition that had so weakened them that they also weren't ready for that. So how we're making those decisions are really important when we're doing things from a distance based.
Yeah. Yeah, no great points. Damien. I think we have, [01:43:00] we have to, we have to include all of that and context is really important I think all the way through in terms of like trading history and have they done something before is a simple, simple question, but actually can influence quite a lot. Um, there's another one actually, uh, that's the other thing that I had meant.
Oh, hold on. Do I still have you? Yeah. Yep. Um, have you seen, um, ortho Toolkit? No. So look up ortho toolkit.com and this is the other thing that I think we need. Um, it is an awesome resource of all of the, um, like your subject, your, your subjective feedback and your objective feedback. So they have every, they have every sort of survey for shoulder.
Knee, hip, foot, ankle, so kind of your disability impacts. They also have just general health ones. I think there's even an oncology one. And then when you all open them, it's like just a fill in the box [01:44:00] for each of those ones. Like they have accessibility to, to every region they have a fill in with a print, my PDF at the end of it, or some of them have a, uh, send to my practitioner and you enter the practitioner email and the practitioner gets a download of it.
Like, that list is golden in terms of your, you know, kind of your journey. And we don't necessarily use it or need it with every person or all the time, but to have a resource of, Hey, we have all of these. Outcome measures that we could select from, from each of these areas. What's like, there's a great one for fast throwers on there compared to the dash.
Like the dash is, um, your shoulder hand dysfunction, but it's like built for the, you know, somebody with 50 with shoulder pain and there's a sports section that's got. Five questions on it in a general sporting context, you go to that fast [01:45:00] thrower one, and now you've got all about long throwing and your confidence with accuracy and your speed outcomes and your measures like, like that ability to have some sport-based ones.
Some, a compendium of like really where my level of confidence is, and even maybe part of our exit interviews from our athletes, from the end of postseason, like, hey, when we go back to your needs analysis and your objectives and your behaviors, like how did we do? How did you do? Did we get where we wanted to?
How excited are you for next off season? What like, like that ability of what I can do and what I've improved on that's targeted around. Either the health seeker or sport is, is really important. Um, because I think that that's another way that we can document, some of them get a bit lengthy or a bit worry or a bit much.
But I think that where we can, again, build that list out, utilize it and inform, uh, a little bit [01:46:00] our distance-based impact, both on the individual reflection and or what we're seeing will build again, that kind of link. So something along those lines where you've got that categorized. Some of them are more, more sport and performance.
Some of them are more just health and wellness, and then there's like a social function and they've got a 36 question or a 12 question. Like, again, I think those are really interesting things that could be a part of our intake or b part of our follow-up even with our, our elite athletes. 'cause so often I get from a rehab journey standpoint, if only I could.
That's very quickly followed up with, but I still can't, so if only I could walk up and down stairs, but I still can't run. Like, as soon as they get that objective, they, they lose the appreciation of that improvement and they look at what they can't do. And that stays as a constant theme of like, and you've gotta kind of keep bringing it back to the successes that they're having [01:47:00] and the expectations of how and where that's gonna take and what time that's gonna take and what that time framing is.
So I think, I think something along those lines would be awesome for us. Um, even if we're not using it with everyone, but to say, Hey, here's the um, IKDC for knees with acls, let's get AZ to fill that out, you know, once every two months or something. And just kind of like have a little bit of a story of what our impact is.
So. Yeah, that, that's a great resource. Damien, I've got it up here so I can see there's, there's so many different ones to choose from. Um, I will definitely be looking at that. Yeah. But I think to to your point, like we definitely need to have success measures, both like for the athlete or the health seeker, but also internally as well, like to track over time, which is why I think we also need to build in somewhere.
Like we need to be able to track like when an athlete has seen a practitioner and when they've received like a supplement plan or when they've done that. So we can really like show the [01:48:00] story over time. Um, we can get into, yeah, and I think the other thing would be, for example, like I think what we need to track is if we've sent a supplement program, was it successful in their adherence to it?
If we sent, like we have athletes where we send them team builder programs and they don't open them or haven't, they're not recording them or they're not registering them. So I think we have to own. Where we're not being successful or not having impact. So if we've sent six, seven supplements, there seems to be a magic number.
If we send three or less, those get adapted. If we send three or more, it all loses. Yeah. Because it becomes too much. So what's, you know, maybe it's one, maybe it's two. But maybe then in future, as we've got someone, then we say, here's our priorities. We're gonna give you these two. Once you're doing those two consistently, we can build on the next thing.
