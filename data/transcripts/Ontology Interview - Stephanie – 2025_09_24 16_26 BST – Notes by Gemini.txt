Ontology Interview - Stephanie - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: There we go. Okay. So, the first question kind of will we'll start with is um just a general question actually. So, how does the the type of sport influence your assessment or intervention choice just on like a high level? Um, how does the different types of sports influence that choice?
Steph Miezin: Yeah. Um I will say well do you mean from a sport energy nutrition requirement or like a culture of sport environment point of view or both?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, if you can separate both of those and explain that would be great.
Steph Miezin: Yeah. So I think depending on the sport of course especially like ends of the spectrum could be uh really high energy demand sports to lower energy demand sports you're going to have a greater need generally for nutrition intervention and monitoring in those higher demand sports. Um, but even with that said, there's some nuance. Like you can think of something like baseball, which you wouldn't think of something like that being super high energy demand, but the volume of games and the length of those games actually do make it a bit of a challenge.
 
 
00:01:20
 
Steph Miezin: Um, and then getting enough not so dissimilar to this cricket situation that we were just talking about. Um, so I think overall demands of the sport, higher energy is going to be higher risk factor and therefore we could need to pay more attention to that. Um, I think there's also some general uh risk factors I suppose to be aware of in different sports that would make me pay more attention such as female athletes where we have more issues typically with body image and how that affects eating behavior. Um, if we have something like weight class sports, that's going to be obviously something that's going to be more intensive. Um, if you have just any situation we're talking about food access and availability, that's where we get a little bit more into the environment of the sport. So, where are they? Is this a collegiate athlete who has access to dining facilities or don't or doesn't or like where where are they at with access to food, whether that be the actual access that's provided to them or if they're in charge of that, do they have financial resources available to to be taking care of that?
 
 
00:02:29
 
Steph Miezin: Um, I think from like a cultural point of view here, there's certain, not to generalize, but there are certain sports and types of athletes and types of people that are more open to nutrition help versus not or have experience with it or know about it or um have some sort of interest. Like uh for example, I did some work with like uh D1 football in the US as part of my graduate degree and like they are it there there's a much smaller percentage of that athlete population who's truly interested in performance nutrition versus the women's soccer team for example. Very different situation. Um and also just the time allowed by those teams and the leadership on those teams for time for nutrition education. Um is that answering your question? Okay.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, that's that's really great insight.
Steph Miezin: Um so yeah it's like what what in the culture and the culture and environment of that sport allows for nutrition to enter and then with the kind of sport the demands those typical type of athletes um general risk factors associated with that kind of sport those those athletes those will indicate if we need more nutrition kind of oversight or Yeah.
 
 
00:03:51
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay, great. Um, so the next question is when a a health seeker or an athlete presents a concern to you, how do you typically assess them? So what we're looking for here are kind of what are your initial assessments uh that you would kind of conduct like what's the name and what's the purpose of those assessments and we'll probably go into a bit more detail of them kind of later on in the interview but just initially when a when an athlete or a health seeker presents that concern how do you typically assess
Steph Miezin: Yeah. So whenever I can, I'll collect data available before speaking with them. So that means lab work. Um if it was a situation where they had DEXA done, then I'll gather that information as well. Um I think especially for older population having the bone mineral density as part of the DEX is really important but if it's younger population sometimes they've only had like a bod pod done for example which will not provide that that's just body composition.
 
 
00:04:53
 
Steph Miezin: Um so I'll collect whatever data is available. Um if it's a situation where they are on a team or have access to tracking of their uh output in training then that kind of data those trends can be really useful as well as the absolutes there with the output. Um so any of that that's available is great to take a look at there. So that's a good starting point for me to get a little bit of an objective point of view of what's going on around that person. And then sometimes, I mean, many times these people present um but before I get to speak with them, I'm getting information just like with this cricket athlete, right? We're getting information from other people around them about what their goals are and what some of their issues seem to be. And so I'll take those down um and that and then when I'm able to meet with that person, I have a general idea, right, of what potentially is going on and what are some potential issues. But I try to not assume because I always want to hear it in their words.
 
 
00:05:53
 
Steph Miezin: So I will speak with the person about like what are your goals? Um what are some obstacles for you? Um sometimes it's interesting what they say their goals are and not necessarily what I've heard their goals are from someone else. So that is something that we need to figure out in those situations. Um, but it's really important for them to say to me what they're looking for as a a an investment in the conversation and to make sure that we're on the same page. Um, I never want to go into something with like, hey, here is your goal. Like, I need you to tell me that kind of it's usually more beneficial. Um, and then I gather nutrition information from them. So, a dietary recall. I typically will do like a 24-hour dietary recall. Um, this is a situation, of course, where I can do one-on-one time with them. Um, so we're going to go through a full day of eating. Um, I ask about portions. I ask about like if they say, "I have cereal for breakfast."
 
 
00:06:53
 
Steph Miezin: Okay, what kind of cereal do you have? What are the approximate portions there? What kind of milk are you using? If it's cow's milk, what's the fat content there? Are you having just one bowl of cereal? Are you putting something in there? Like all of those kinds of questions. It's an interrogation. Um, and uh, we'll go through their day. I also will ask about if it wasn't a typical day, what are some other situations that might come into the picture like eating out or specific to athletes, what if this was a game day, what if this was a travel day or eating at the facility versus home, etc. So, I really try to get an understanding of a full dietary recall, but then try to apply that to different kinds of days as well. um that allows me to understand to some degree dietary quality, overall energy intake, macronutrient intake and split throughout the day, timing, habits, etc. Um in a situation where you are unable to really do that full recall with someone, there are food frequency questionnaires and things like that available.
 
 
00:07:58
 
Steph Miezin: Um, honestly, because I have been able to work so much with individuals, which is typically what sports dietitians do, like we don't typically use food frequency questionnaires, and maybe we're going to talk about this later, but I can send you some or give you the names of some, but and that is maybe more general where we don't have such a hightouch opportunity with people, but the vast majority of my experience is really doing that deep work with individuals and being able to assess Um so yeah so get the objective data get the subjective data for them specific to um their dietary intake. I also really try to assess relationship with food whether that's a direct question or me just picking up on cues with language and habits and mindset around food. That is so important. Um I can't even tell you. Um it depending on the population you're working with as well. I've seen this really really specifically with older people, but it absolutely exists with younger people too where they don't even realize that their relationship with food is totally dictating all of their behaviors around eating and habits and it's truly not even knowledge about nutrition or what they should be doing.
 
 
00:09:18
 
Steph Miezin: It's really mindset and then that's a whole another conversation and direction to go in to support them too. Um, and then I'll try to ask them any other additional information that that I wasn't able to gather otherwise like specific to athletes injury history if we didn't get a good picture of that before or if they have what what is their history of any dietary patterns that they were following before like being vegetarian or anything like that or intermittent fasting for example something like that. Um, and then I also try to get an idea of what kind of plan works for them because not the same plan works for everyone. So, for some people, like a lower level uh type of plan would be something like a plate model. So, I do ratios of the plate with different food groups on there that they should be trying to aim for for different kinds of days or goals depending on where they're at. Um, or we can get a specific as super detailed meal plan with exact portions of almost everything on the plate.
 
 
00:10:17
 
Steph Miezin: Um and then I typically always do that with um a variet like multiple options for each meal period. So it's not just this is breakfast like people don't work like that typically, right? Like you need to have a couple options for breakfast and they need to be applicable to like are they making the food, where are they? Is this on the go? Like it has to incorporate all that kind of stuff. So yeah, that's a pretty typical situation.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Great. Thanks for the detail on that, Stephanie. We're going to delve into a lot of what you just said in in a bit more detail. Um, so today I think we're going to focus on dietary quality as one of the constructs. Um, but just high level, can you just list off what other constructs or characteristics you aim to kind of measure and understand when you're trying to kind of provide nutrition support?
Steph Miezin: I
Dr. Naomi Myhill: So with dietary quality and energy intake being two, what are the other ones that you would be looking to to assess
 
 
00:11:17
 
Steph Miezin: I kind of as a subcategory of of energy intake like adequate energy intake I would be where is that energy coming from and does that make sense for that athlete for their body type situation. Um, their goals for where they're at currently with performance and maybe long-term goals as well. Um, so are we getting enough carbohydrate for all of those things? Are we getting enough protein for all of those things? Are we getting a decent amount of fats from all of those things? And from a dietary quality perspective, we overlap those things then and say, are we getting enough like fats are a good example. Are we are we getting enough fats? And then are those coming from appropriate sources? Are we getting mostly unsaturated fats for example? Um so appropriate adequate appropriate macronutrient split or ratio would be something that I'm definitely looking at. Um timing is another one. Uh so do we have good habits around timing? Is it all over the place? Um are they how open are they?
 
 
00:12:27
 
Steph Miezin: Generally, right? How open are they to change? Usually when people come to us or to a entity like this, they're pretty open to change. So hopefully that is part of the picture here. But that's something I like to assess. Um I think I'm also looking at Oh boy, it's so many things. Um, I'm also trying to get a sense for like specific for athletes specific around their competition, games, training, what does that timing and habits look like? and then GI issues around that specifically whether it is um something they believe to be true about eating not eating eating certain foods around training or competition or actual GI issues or distress around that um which is so common uh to have like game stomach where you feel uneasy you have nerves etc it's hard to eat that shows up differently for everyone but it is really common and so assessing like does that exist in what situations does it exist? What have you been able to do in terms of eating and what are some area what are like I always like to in any of these things where I'm assessing it's like what is the boundary that you have and where is there space to push that boundary if we can towards a situation that's better for you.
 
 
00:13:59
 
Steph Miezin: Um yes what else am I trying to assess? I think in the case of if if somebody has a dietary restriction, are we not just meeting macronutrient needs but micronutrient needs um you could also say that for anyone who is removing any sort of food or food group from their diet, are we meeting the nutrient needs that might be lost from that food group? So vegan is a really good example. Um I think I'll give you like a quick example if I can just to like show how all these pieces come together. at the team where I'm at right now, we have a vegan athlete and she's been vegan for a few years. Um, and so when I and she has a history of not keeping on body weight or muscle mass throughout the season and she has a um an issue with lipids partially because of family history. So when I'm doing a dietary recall with her, I'm like, are you getting enough energy? Well, are we getting enough energy throughout the seasons, especially protein and carbohydrate to maintain your body composition?
 
 
00:14:59
 
Steph Miezin: And then are we meeting micronutrient needs because you're vegan? Like do we need to look at supplementation or what kind of products are you taking that might be fortified like calcium? Um typically you're getting that from dairy, but if you're having enough dairy alternatives that are calcium fortified, then we might be okay there. So all those things and then she gets injured and then we need to increase protein and look at energy manipulation to make sure that she's getting enough but not too like all of those things. So, um, I feel like I'm rambling, but hopefully this is helpful.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: It's all good. It's all good. Don't worry. It It's It's informative. Um and you're answering the question, which is the main thing.
Steph Miezin: Great.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Fair. Um were there any more um capabilities or characteristics you you would aim to measure? If not, we'll we'll move on to specifically talking about dietary quality.
Steph Miezin: um cooking like um self-efficacy with actually getting food on the table for themselves, whether that be grocery shopping, maintaining a kitchen with food, actually preparing the food, all of those things.
 
 
00:16:13
 
Steph Miezin: Um food safety. Honestly, like I there you I have some athletes who will not eat chicken at home because they are afraid of the food safety aspect of it. Like that's a real thing. Um so that is one and then like as an aside to that like where is that food coming from? We have many people who are able to provide them food whether that be chefs or facilities or something. So that's going to be important there. Travel is really big of course like what their schedule looks like and what's possible for them. It's also really helpful to understand if we have a traveling athlete if they've done that travel before or if they haven't because that helps us understand how like they can give us information then about what's going to be available or what's a likely scenario versus an athlete who's who's new at travel or has a new kind of travel where we're both kind of figuring out together. So that can be important. Um I mean supplements, we didn't really talk about this.
 
 
00:17:11
 
Steph Miezin: That's kind of part of the whole conversation. But as I do a dietary recall, supplements are of course part of that. So I'm assessing what are they taking, comparing that to blood work, for example, comparing that to um their goals. Do those supplements make sense? Do those dosages make sense? Um um I mentioned relationship with food. This is a really really big one again uh where sometimes like that person needs to have another referral to some sort of mental health provider for additional support. I as a sports dietician that's not my specific area and I can help up to a point and then we need to have additional support. So that's really important because if we're not fixing that, if we're not focusing on that, then the rest of my plan and recommendations truly won't be very useful. Um, I think those would really be the main ones.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: That's great. We've got a a big list to go through over the next couple of months.
Steph Miezin: There's a lot.
 
 
00:18:16
 
Steph Miezin: Yeah, there's a lot.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay. So, we'll we'll focus on um dietary quality as the the first construct to kind of deep dive in today. So for dietary quality and you might have mentioned some of these already but what assessments would you use to measure dietary quality with both unlimited and kind of high resource. So the reason we're asking you to kind of try and differentiate between the two is just based off of our kind of service model. we will have remote support and then kind of inerson support as well based off the different membership levels. Um so firstly like is there a way to assess with unlimited um sorry unlimited and low resource is what I what I meant to say earlier but yeah can you split them up? Um what assessments would you use? So we're looking there for the name of the assessment. Um you can describe um the purpose of it as well. And so what I'll do is then ask you questions about each of those assessments in detail.
 
 
00:19:23
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: So if you could initially kind of just list them into unlimited resource and low resource and then we're going to go through each of those in detail. Does that make sense? I I know I I ravebled a lot there. So if you want me to clarify, let me know.
Steph Miezin: No, no, that totally makes sense. Um, so I will preface this again with I will I will talk about some resources here, but typically if we have a high high touch high resource situation where and what I mean by that is like a one-on-one like if you're really able to speak with that person and have the time to do that then typically those these resources are not really often used um because you are like you can use them but they don't tell you about dietary quality for that specific person. They just tell you general dietary quality compared to overall general health recommendations. So, I think that's important. Um, these are not super often used in athletics because for example like they typically in athletics we have really high energy needs and it can be hard to meet them if we're not including some foods that are of lower nutrient density that in a typical healthy population we would want to have less of.
 
 
00:20:38
 
Steph Miezin: They are these foods become important tools in the athletic population. So like candy for example um if you look at a dietary quality uh screener those are going to say if you're having more of that that your dietary quality is poorer but that might not be the case in athletic population because that is playing an important role in overall energy intake which has a larger impact on health and performance at that time in that athletes life. So, that was a bit of a ramble, but um I will say like generally it's important to know in a um high resourced um one-on-one athletic situation, screeners like this are not typically used. Um I think screeners, right, are a little bit more general, which is the purpose of screening because you don't you're not able to do the 101. Um but a good one to be aware of is the Prime Diet Quality Score Screener. Um, the rapid one in particular is a shorter one that might be good to be aware of here. Um, I can send you is there is there like a can I send like a little link in the chat because I can send you this um in call messages.
 
 
00:21:45
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, you should be able to
Steph Miezin: That's me. Okay. So, um, at the at the end of this document, like page 15 or page 16, it starts it starts talking about specifically what the screener is looking at. So, it's looking at different um, uh, food groups and specifically honing in on things that are generally considered to be more or less healthpromoting. Um, I am annoying in that I don't like to use the word healthy or not healthy for foods because I don't feel like it's truly accurate. Um, foods are generally not they don't specifically make you healthy or unhealthy. It's not how it works. It's about dietary quality and patterns over time overall, how everything fits together. And then we apply that to that individual. Um, so like you could have someone, it's interesting, this Cricut athlete again comes to mind. You could have someone who has decent dietary quality, which it seems like he does. He's focusing on nutrient-dense, healthy foods, but that diet might not be great because he's not getting enough overall.
 
 
00:23:01
 
Steph Miezin: So, it's not that high dietary quality is the top thing to to like achieve for great nutrition. That's a big piece of the puzzle, but it's not the only one. Um so this questionnaire in particular looks at things like processed meats, um red meats, uh fish, dairy, fast food, sodas or sugary drinks, um grains, whole grains or um refined grains, sweets, um legumes, veggies, whole fruits, and then nuts and seeds and stuff. So that gives us a decent idea of the frequency and portions of these pretty much all of our most of our um foods or food groups. So then there's a scoring system um associated with that to give us a general idea of how nutrientdense someone's diet is compared to this. Um so I think this is useful in a less resourced environment. I like this one in particular because it's not super duper long. It's pretty easy for someone to fill out. There's like 13 questions overall. Um, and they're answering them all in the same way. So, for me, I think this is pretty helpful.
 
 
00:24:15
 
Steph Miezin: Um, like it it depends on the individual, but like in so many like we're not we're not doing research here. we're trying to figure out what is the best course of action for an individual and sometimes more information isn't better. So for me this can be really useful. And then in addition to that we there could be other questions about timing and habits and stuff like that. But specific to dietary quality I think this is a tool that I would really highlight.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: That's great. Um, so that would be your kind of low resource option to to use. Are there any other low resource kind of options you'd use to measure dietary quality?
Steph Miezin: Yes, there are um there is one called the mini eat which is a nine question one um to validate or to to look at dietary quality. Um that is one I'm a little bit less familiar with but it does exist. Um it's interesting though because there's a lot of overlap with these tools. are all essentially asking the same thing which is here are the food groups how much of these do you typically eat you know how frequently like they're all kind of looking at that same question so that is one to be aware of um there's also the healthy eating index which compares to the dietary guidelines for Americans so that is one that can be considered um there's there's also like oh I haven't used these in a long
 
 
00:25:58
 
Steph Miezin: There are some tools that like you can pay for where you people do this whole like survey thing they fill out where there's like pictures and they say how much of this and do you add this and like it's like a whole thing that someone can do to get like a more um in-depth assessment of dietary quality. But again, that is typically done when you don't have a like a provider available. Um, and there's no other resources that are really being used to help someone like I think in in this situation where you have all this infrastructure around that and you're using things like AI to my understanding is how this is going to be used part of that then I'm not sure that that becomes the most helpful best way to do it. I think you can use some of these other tools and then link things together.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. And I think yeah, our our kind of underpinning is utilizing AI and building building out different things that we can really try and maximize.
 
 
00:27:00
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: So your input on that would be uh really useful as well in terms of like nutrition assessments and also interventions when we get to that point. Um so for those kind of the first two surveys you mentioned um would you prioritize I think it was the the prime dietary quality. Would you prioritize that one over the mini uh survey because you said they kind of are quite similar. So, how would we differentiate between the two? It's also fine if you don't have an answer for that as well.
Steph Miezin: Yeah, I mean they are just kind of comparing them here. They are quite similar. Um the the eat one does ask about alcohol. So that could be relevant to some populations for sure. Um and they also they they ask like a little bit differently, right? So like the eat one says, "How often do you eat unprocessed red meat versus processed meat?" Which someone might not know what that is. But then in the um the what is the first one called?
 
 
00:28:16
 
Steph Miezin: The P I always forget this one. PDQS one. Um they ask about it a little bit more specifically. They say processed meats are sausages, salami, etc. So I don't know if I have a good answer for you to be quite honest. like um I think they both have some pros and cons and it's not like you can't take you can't take the first one for example the the rapid diet uh quality assessment and add an alcohol question you know
Dr. Naomi Myhill: That's fine.
Steph Miezin: like that could be an option so I don't know if I have a strong opinion Um, sorry,
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Um, and that's for kind of us to gather within the ontology as well. So, um, are there any other assessments that you would use to measure dietary quality?
Steph Miezin: my vacuum is starting. One second. I need to turn it off.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: That's okay. Is it an automatic vacuum?
Steph Miezin: Yeah, I know.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Wow.
 
 
00:29:14
 
Steph Miezin: I hate vacuuming.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: That's That's next level.
Steph Miezin: It is pretty great, but it just like starts sometimes and I'm like not ready. Um, are there other
Dr. Naomi Myhill: That's crazy. Okay. Well, yeah. Yeah, that would that probably my question is um so you've mentioned the surveys and I would like to follow up on the the onetoone consult anyway um from from a kind of high resourced perspective just to get some more information on that. But are there any other measures apart from kind of those three that you mentioned already?
Steph Miezin: Yes. I mean there there are so so many out there um many of which are not necessarily validated. Um, I am happy to do a little bit more work to like dig and see if I feel like there's anything else that I feel like would compare to this or be better, but my quick answer is no.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah.
Steph Miezin: Like these are really commonly used and known about. There's a reason for that.
 
 
00:30:12
 
Steph Miezin: They're validated. So I those would be the main ones main ones in terms of validated questionnaires. Um, yeah, I can get to your other question about like individual like high resource stuff too, but I think to answer that first one, I'm happy to do more work and dig into it, but like my initial answer is like I think this is like a really solid place.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah. And that and that's fine really. We kind of want to kind of take your what you would implement in that situation. So yeah, you don't necessarily need to reel off a hundred different surveys of questionnaires because I imagine there's quite a lot.
Steph Miezin: Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: So yeah, the two is fine because also for us, you know, like in in what we're trying to build, we don't want to be offering up like even 10 different questionnaires or the 10 different surveys because then how
Steph Miezin: Yes.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: do we how do we scale like like if they're different, they're kind of looking at different things or there's different ways that they're scoring, it's really hard um to scale that.
 
 
00:31:13
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: So and interpret that on a kind of bigger level. Um so no that that is fine. Um one follow-up question just based off of those surveys is just how how would the either the health seek or the athletes like current state influence how you would assess the kind of results of those? Would there be anything in particular you'd say reassess or don't do it on this day for example?
Steph Miezin: like um in terms of completing the survey or
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah. In terms of completing the survey, um is there any implications around if the let's say it's an athlete, if they're injured at the time or they're kind of in a low mood state, um the same for a health seeker as well. Is there anything around that kind of wider context for their the athletes current state or the health's current state you'd say, okay, we need to just be aware of this as a kind of additional constraint?
Steph Miezin: the the mood part is interesting. Um, I think on a like um common sense level that makes sense for someone to fill it out where they're in a good state of mind.
 
 
00:32:24
 
Steph Miezin: Um, but I'm unaware of like any actual research that looks at like a mood state and how that affects someone filling this out. I don't even know if that's been looked at if that's a question. So, that's interesting. But I think for sure if we're talking about a situation where someone is injured or something else, ill, something where they're not doing their normal dietary pattern, then yes, these should be prefaced with what is your typical intake. I think it depends on the individual like how how long is that state that they're in going to last? Like if someone is injured, for example, if they are if they sprain their ankle, that's different from having just ruptured their ACL. So like that is going to play a role in how we think about them filling out that information. Um, specific though to dietary quality and not d overall energy intake, there hopefully shouldn't be too much of a difference in in the dietary quality. Um, we typically just see overall intake of everything go down a little bit when it comes to injury or illness.
 
 
00:33:36
 
Steph Miezin: typically um it's the overall energy intake part that's perhaps shifting the most I believe. So that is not necessarily measured by these tools. Um this is just the quality not the energy overall intake. Um, but I think in applying this information, yes, it's going to it's going to make a difference. Like specific to something like injury recovery, like are we getting enough whole foods and great plant-based nutrients that are going to be supporting that recovery and and all of that? Um, but if it's something like, "Oh, I'm sick this week. Sorry. I'm sorry about that. I hope you feel better, but I need you to fill this out like your normal thing because next week you will not be sick, you know. Um, so yeah, I think it depends like on how long of a time frame they expect to be in that um uncommon state.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense. Um, okay, cool. So let's circle back um to high resource assessments of dietary quality.
 
 
00:34:46
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: So you mentioned the the consult. Um we we can dive into that, but are there any other assessments or does it all fit kind of within that within that consult would be your go-to as an assessment from a high resource perspective?
Steph Miezin: Yeah, it it would be Yeah.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah. Okay, great. So, we'll we'll dig into that a bit further. Um, with those kind of one-to-one consults, um, do you tend to do those in person online? Is there a difference between the kind of online version compared to the the in-person version?
Steph Miezin: It's always better in person, but it it's always harder um to make that happen, you know. Um especially with this kind of company um the infrastructure um in person you are always going to get a little bit more information. They generally feel more comfortable with you because you are there with them to share a little bit more. Um it it can be helpful sometimes in terms of um quantifying portions that they're having where you can do this on on on the computer but it is a little bit different a person like if I say they say okay I always have rice for dinner I'm like okay well how much do you have like typically if a fist this size is about a cup are you having this much and they'll look at that and they'll
 
 
00:36:08
 
Steph Miezin: think about it and that is I feel a little bit more effective in person but I it can be effective digitally as well I I do think so Um, I think it's it's just different when you have someone in the room, right? Like you're just you're sharing more. It's a little bit more relaxed. Um, but that doesn't make it bad. I think you just we as practitioners need to be really intentional about how we're showing up and making them feel comfortable and and creating those relationships.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, that that makes so much sense and it it transfers across a lot of other disciplines as well, I think, with that inerson stuff for sure. Um, so in your consults, what are can you describe the kind of the key steps and the cues that you might use to make sure I suppose that you're getting some sort of consistency within the information that you gather from kind of those different consults that you do. So, what are your kind of prep steps? Um, do you have any kind of step-by-step kind of protocol documentation for these types of consults?
 
 
00:37:20
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Um, and then are there any kind of common mistakes that people might make within these consults as well?
Steph Miezin: Um, do you make common mistakes like from the client or the practitioner's point of view?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Um, from the practitioners perspective, um, then that will help us inform our protocols I think.
Steph Miezin: Okay. Okay. Yes. So, I have an I have an outline that I use where um for a dietary recall, it has breakfast, it a space for morning time eating, if I'm working with an athletic population or a team, for example. I try to put in specifically before training, during training, after training, and I'll ask about all of all of these things that I'm listing. So, all of the eating opportunities throughout the day that I want to be aware of and capture, I put down as a line that needs to be filled out so I don't forget about asking about it. Um, I also have specific lines for things like supplements, relationship with food. That is one where I don't necessarily ask what is your relationship with food.
 
 
00:38:24
 
Steph Miezin: Sometimes I do if it seems appropriate with that person, but you I can generally get a feel for that and then I'll make my own note there. Um, timing is part of this as well. So, um, for all those eating opportunities, I will put in timing if it's if I'm unaware of what that timing is for that person. Um, bedtime, sleep time, that schedule is also impactful here on how that affects their eating and then how that affects like how they go back and forth. Basically, the interplay between those two things. Um I will capture how this changes based on travel, based on competition, based on off days. So that be timing or um if there are different eating opportunities typically typically there's less eating opportunities on days where people are not doing training for example. This is specific to athletes. Um, but you can say the same for anyone potentially whether it's like a weekend versus weekday and they are working a 9 toive typical kind of job that's going to affect their schedule of eating.
 
 
00:39:28
 
Steph Miezin: So I'm capturing their overall schedule. Um, and I have all these lines filled out or available for me to fill out so I don't forget. Um, I also have space where I have their lab work next to all of this where I can, you know, keep that front of mind. I'll make notes of course ahead of time for myself on like um for example if they have low iron and I can see that in lab work right there but sometimes I'll make a note of like to ask about that specifically or to pay attention to different types of foods that they're eating. Um of course we're asking about supplement intake like I just said. Um, in terms I mean there's so many aspects of like the overall like intake that we're doing, but really specific to like the nutrition part of things here. For each eating opportunity, I am taking note of the kinds of foods that they're eating and the portions that they're eating. Um, I try to do that by specifically asking like you in person typically is how we're doing this, right?
 
 
00:40:32
 
Steph Miezin: Like we use our hands or I have a container nearby where we're we are on the same page visually about what that is. So I try to get a a good understanding of what those portions are of those foods. Um, and then differences between different categories within a category of food. So if they say I have steak for dinner, typically or often I say, "Okay, cool. What kind of steak is that?" Like, "Do you know the cut? Do you know how lean it is?" Or I explain to them that the marbling is yummy and means there's more fat content in there. So I'll I'll get a feel for that. Or the fat content of the milk. Or if they say, "I'm having ice cream." Not all ice cream is created equally. Are we having hogen dyes? Are we having store brand? Like the overrun is different. Totally different. So, I'll try to get an idea for the energy density and differences between different kinds of foods within the same food category where applicable.
 
 
00:41:31
 
Steph Miezin: So, I can get an idea of what that intake actually is and what their preferences are um or what's available to them. So, snacks are a really good example of that. They say, "I have a granola bar or a protein bar. Cool. What kind?" Those are all very different. they are not the same. Um, so like and is that a brand that they is that a type of product that they have available that's why they're eating it or they like it or it's affordable or whatever the case is. Um, so I try to get brands whenever I can for not only better nutrition information but also just preferences and habits. Um, whenever and this is like such a key to I think a successful plan. Whenever we are leveraging foods and habits that already work for someone and enjoyable and are enjoyable, we are putting ourselves in a much better situation for that plan to be successful for that person. It's just sustainable. It's enjoyable. Like convenience, all those things really drive success and adherence over time.
 
 
00:42:32
 
Steph Miezin: Um sometimes depending on the person, cooking method can be really important here too. Like if they say I have I make vegetables for myself, I'm like, "Okay, like are you steaming those? Are you roasting those? Are you throwing those in a sauté pan with like a cup of oil?" Like what does that look like? So I'll try to get an idea for food preparation when and if they are making their own food. Um which is not as often as one would think sometimes with a lot of people, but that is absolutely part of it. So food prep and specifically like how much oil or fats they're using for that food preparation. Um, you know, sometimes a question that's not always asked but is important is, are you eating everything on your plate? Like, you're saying this is what's on your plate, but are you actually eating all of that? That's different. So, that can be included in this. Um, and whenever possible, having some sort of picture food log to compare can be extremely useful because food, even though we're going to all this detail about what they're eating, these are still notoriously inaccurate because people do not they underestimate, overestimate, forget about what they're eating.
 
 
00:43:56
 
Steph Miezin: So, if we can have some sort of food journal, picture, something to follow up and compare, that can be really, really useful. Um, I just had one of the athletes I was just working with at this team had a situation like that where she was saying, "Yeah, I was having two pancakes every morning for breakfast and we do this food log situation for an energy expenditure test." And she's having one and she's like, "Oh, yeah, blah blah blah." So, like those can be really helpful as well.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, that that does make a lot of sense. Um, so just to follow up before you do this inerson kind of dietary recall, what information do you need or or do you think is optimal that you should have? So before you go into this 24-hour dietary recall inerson session with an athlete or a health seeker, what what assessments or kind of information do you think you should already have before you go into that?
Steph Miezin: Um, I think the blood work can be really useful. I think specific to athletes, um, having blood work that gives me an idea of potential for uh, proper energy availability.
 
 
00:45:17
 
Steph Miezin: I know we're talking about dietary quality here, but that's a that is a huge one. um not relevant to all populations but extremely important for some populations. Um so if I have blood work that shows high high lipid levels and low T3 in particular then that those are flags right there for me that that person's probably not eating enough. Um and it's interesting because if I have those but their dietary recall says they're doing great then we might not be totally honest, right? or they might not realize that they're not reporting well. Could be any of those things. So, having lab work that gives me some insight into potential dietary trends can be useful there. Again, like the ones that I most typically use are going to be their lipid profile, um their their iron profile, um their uh T3, which is really useful for low energy availability. Um and vitamin D is interesting, too. that's a little bit less dietary quality or whatever. It's just so hard to get enough of that for some people, but that is part of that as well.
 
 
00:46:28
 
Steph Miezin: Um, yeah, th those are the major ones. There's there's many other little ones, but lab work in general. My answer is lab work that can be useful. And then if we have a DEXA, that can be useful um for body composition, for bone mineral density. Um, I think I had kind of mentioned those in the beginning. Uh, I think if we have other tests available, especially if it's like longer term data, we have some patterns available with how their performance is doing, I can try to relate that to what they're telling me in terms of what they're eating and then how that just fits into the overall periodization of of a of um a season. or if it's somebody who's not an athlete, what are their goals and what does that overall timeline look like? All of that is going to be relevant to what they're eating. Um, what other information like trends in weight of course I feel like that's a given. I didn't say that, but that is going to be super important.
 
 
00:47:34
 
Steph Miezin: Trends in weight. Um, if we have trends in body composition, that's even better, but often times that's not available. Um, those are the main ones.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, that's great to kind of have that information so we can build that in. Okay, before you have a onetoone, this information needs to be provided to nutritionists for example. So yeah, that's really useful. Um just look at the time. I know we've only got 10 minutes. So just just briefly based off of um that kind of one-to-one consult um with the dietary recall, what what type of interventions would you maybe start to prescribe based off of that? So we don't have to go into too too much detail because I know we've not got too much time. So we'll probably follow up on this on another call. just kind of high level if you can just give me a bit of an overview of some of the interventions that you might then start to think about off the back of those those dietary recalls.
 
 
00:48:38
 
Steph Miezin: Yeah. Specific to dietary quality.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yes, please.
Steph Miezin: Yes. Okay. So, whether you're an athlete or not, um there is some research that shows that having like four to five cups of combined fruits and veggies a day can be really helpful in decreasing risk of disease development over time. So that is something I try to look for. Um if we are like we're look the big view here is are we hitting all the food groups period. Are you are you missing any food groups? Are you not having dairy because you're lactose intolerant for example? Are you vegetarian so you're not having uh animal products to some extent? Um are we missing any food groups there? Is there space to fill in that food group if you're open to eating it? Okay. Yes. Then let's address that. Right? If you're not having yogurt because you just forgot about that exists, which honestly is a thing, then can we get yogurt in like that?
 
 
00:49:32
 
Steph Miezin: Like, so what are you missing? Are you open to including it? Let's focus on that. Let's do it in ways that are enjoyable to you. What are clear opportunity areas like a snack time or a breakfast time that make sense for that kind of food? Um, it has to be enjoyable. This is where like the people part comes in. I hate giving people nutrition plans where I don't know enough about them because we're we're all going to fail. Like it has to be so specific to that person and what they want to do. Um what else? I think food groups overall, right? Are we hitting all the food groups? Great. And then are we getting enough of those? So if we look at like I mean carbohydrates not a food group but starches within the carbohydrate umbrella. Are we getting those throughout the day? Are we getting them relatively spaced throughout the day? Are we having enough portions specific to training time for example or whatever.
 
 
00:50:33
 
Steph Miezin: Um so it's like filtering. Are you getting this? Are you getting it enough? Are you getting it at the right times throughout the day? Are you getting it consistently? are you getting it with a decent um frequency throughout the day? And then we can look at the type of those things too. So that can be dietary quality as well. Like if they're having starches, cool. Are they only having refined grains? Maybe that's not a huge deal for having enough of other plant-based foods in the diet to make up for that fiber, but maybe there's space to introduce some whole grains like whole wheat bread or pasta or something sometimes. So that would be something that I'm looking for as well. And in terms of like how to approach this, doing it all at once is probably not a great idea. So it's like what are going to be the biggest impact areas first? So often that is fruits and vegetables for people. That just happens to be a really common one um for different reasons. So I will kind of start there like okay can we add I'm like what fruit do you like? What vegetable do you like? I only like broccoli. Okay, can we have broccoli? You know even if it's twice a day can you do that? and you say yes, okay, fine. Like we're making we're going somewhere, you know, and then we can try to build and branch out from there. So, um that would be what I would say for that one. Yeah. Yes.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: That's great. Thanks, Stephanie. We've uh we've covered quite a bit and I know there's still quite a bit more to cover, but for today, we'll we'll finish the the kind of the interview there.
