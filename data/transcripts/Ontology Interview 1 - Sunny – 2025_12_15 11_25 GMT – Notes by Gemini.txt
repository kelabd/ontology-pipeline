Ontology Interview 1 - Sunny - Transcript
00:00:00
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay, I think we are we're recording. So, we are ready to roll. Brilliant. So, um just to start off and get some context, um first question, um can you describe your primary areas of expertise with peptides? So, which categories of peptides do you most commonly use? For example,
Vivek Chander: So on my primary expertise in peptides is that I'm super interested in them. So, I've actually gone through a peptide mastermind course back in October. Um, uh, I don't know if you know what I do, but like, you know, my a lot of what I do is, uh, on on the work of quality and compliance. So, I'm really interested in how compliance fits in in the peptide world. Um, I've experimented usage with myself, but I have not actually prescribed peptides to any specific patient as of yet. Uh, I've also advised companies on how to build kind of compliant peptide programs.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay, great. Um, and that's fine in terms of your expertise.
 
 
00:01:28
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: It'd be great to just get that that overview of what you know and try and download that information and we can go into more detail um in different aspects as well. So, I'll continue kind of with the line of of question within our structure um and just answer to kind of to the best of your knowledge um if you can. So, how do peptides kind of fit into I suppose the broader approach to um kind of metabolic or longevity care? So, where do they sit alongside other types of suppose interventions like lifestyle, supplements, nutrition?
Vivek Chander: Yeah. No, I I think that in if you use the longevity pyramid as a framework, um I think the most important thing is the lifestyle interventions, whether it be diet, exercise, you know, I would even put gut microbiome in there. I would put sleep in there. Um and then I would also put like you know anxiety um social connection kind of uh elements in that kind of bottom layer of the longevity pyramid. I think the second uh portion of that pyramid would be um supplementation and maybe kind of uh medications to target improvement things like metformin um you know lipid tovastatin um things that would you know target specific medical interventions and I think like as you go up that that longevity pyramid The next level would be something like peptides
 
 
00:03:12
 
Vivek Chander: uh which would uh like allow for a little bit more precisionbased individualistic treatment. Um, and then as you go up even further, that's when you kind of get to kind of regenerative medicine, um, stem cell therapies and and the such
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Okay, great. Um, next kind of just moving specifically to what capabilities kind of characteristics or I guess physiological systems do peptides target in your view? So for example like tissue repair
Vivek Chander: Yeah. No, I mean there's so there's so many different targets, right? So if you look at uh something like BPC57 that targets tissue repair, but it also uh you know promotes angioenesis. So there's actually some effect for cardiac repair like there's there's use cases for uh you know for patients to use it after a heart attack. Um things like alpha you know thyosin one it's it's really uh you know used for immune support. So uh you know it's used for for people who have been uh suffering from long COVID. It's also used to enhance vaccine efficacy like to use it like one or two weeks before actually taking a vaccine.
 
 
00:04:50
 
Vivek Chander: It'll help with the um help with the efficacy of the vaccine. Um there are you know growth hormone secrets like serarellin and tesmarellin um that help with tissue repair as well but also uh some of these things help with sleep efficacy as well as um uh fat redistribution in the body. Um there are specific ones that help with skin uh like GHK copper helps with skin um enhancement and um uh increasing elast elasticity and collagen production in skin. Um, so there's so many of them right now and they all have like different effects um that I would start with that and then you know we can get into the specific peptides later I
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah,
Vivek Chander: guess.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: I guess my my follow-up question would be um yeah, for each I suppose each of those peptide classes, what's the primary construct that you aim to change? So like is and you me you mentioned a few of them there. So I don't know how many different peptides there there are there different classes there are.
 
 
00:06:10
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: You're the expert in that. So, if you can if you have the ability to go through some of them now, um we can always follow up kind of later if you want to document them kind of on paper and send them over as well if that's easier. But if you if you can just like really kind of concisely
Vivek Chander: Sure.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: explain for each class like what's the primary construct that's aimed to change with them, that would be great information for us to gather.
Vivek Chander: Um so let's start off with like BPC57, right? So again um it is being used for uh muscularkeeletal injuries, right? So, the way I use it is I use it uh for 20 days as like when I'm like doing kind of um a lot more kind of resistance training and it it actually definitely enhances my recovery. Uh the other use cases for BPC57 are for gastrointestinal disorders. So, people are using it for leaky gut and uh inflammatory bowel disease. Um there's a use case for postsurgical uh repair enhancement too.
 
 
00:07:22
 
Vivek Chander: Um people who have to use uh NSAID so like ibuprofen for a long period of time you end up getting like gut breakdown. Um so uh there have been some kind of uh mouse and rat studies showing that if you use BPC57 it's uh like it protects your stomach lining so you don't end up with like peptic ulcer disease. So those are like the primary indications for BPC 157. Um the way it typically works is it uh enhances angioenesis um and it modulates VEGF. Um it reduces inflammatory cytoinins. Um not a lot of side effects to this one specifically. Um the thought is that you should not use it on the daily for long periods of time because there is a cancer concern. uh it may upregulate VEGF receptors which actually um like if you do have a tumor it'll actually st like uh add gasoline to the fire of a tumor. So uh this is not one that you you want to get close to anybody who has cancer for sure. Um, some orthopedic physicians are actually using BPC 157 uh before they actually do injections with PRP.
 
 
00:08:54
 
Vivek Chander: Um, and they're seeing that by actually almost pre-treating um patients with this um it actually enhances the effects of like PRP and I I'm sure that's will hold true for like stem cell therapy as well. Um, so that's BPC 157. If you have any kind of follow-up
Dr. Naomi Myhill: All good for now.
Vivek Chander: questions
Dr. Naomi Myhill: I think we'll probably it'll be a good structure just go through the list just exactly what you've done there, Sunny. Like in terms of being concise and and saying those key constructs that was great. Um and then kind of this the next part of the the interview will be what do you do before you you choose a peptide and kind of going into some of that that information there. So, if we can kind of get through the list of those now and I'll follow up on some of the details kind of in one. That makes
Vivek Chander: Um, from a cascade point of view too,
Dr. Naomi Myhill: sense.
Vivek Chander: like uh BPC 157 is Wada prohibited?
 
 
00:09:57
 
Vivek Chander: So like I guess like just for the those sort of folks in Cascade, do you want me to like mention like that as well or no?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah. Yeah. And that's definitely something we want to understand is like what are the contra indications for each of those and that is you know have they like you mentioned there with the cancer then also from a wider or um NSF approval standard we need to know that information is it going to be can we use it with athletes as well as health seekers or is it just for health seekers for example
Vivek Chander: Okay. Yeah. So, uh just in general with all of these uh peptides, um I'll I'll just say this once because it holds true for all of them. for for the Wada, most of these are going to be prohibited, but uh if it's out of your system for at least three weeks before, it's not going to be noted on any blood panels. So, from what I understand, a lot of the athletes tend to use these off season and not on season because they don't know when they're going to get random blood tested.
 
 
00:11:03
 
Vivek Chander: So that that would be the potential kind of use case for athletes and they're all using it more than the general population. Um so uh BPC57 last note is that it is not there are only two or three of these that are FDA approved. So I'll call that out too. BPC57 is not FDA approved. The next um the next one we can talk about is thyosin beta 4. uh also not FDA approved, also used for um wound healing, postsurgical recovery. Um and there's actually some really good pre-clinical data about being protective postart attacks. Um and some people are also using this for long COVID recovery. um also promotes angioenesis. It reduces fibrosis and scarring. Um it helps with stem cell recruitment and activation. Um really well tolerated but again not a lot of human safety data. Um some people are also using it for like chronic non-healing wounds in like diabetics. Uh and I think that there is some um some of the opthalmologists are also using it for ocular tissue repair as well.
 
 
00:12:42
 
Vivek Chander: um really no known contra indications also water prohibited uh often used with BPC57. I don't know if you've heard of the Wolverine protocol, but it kind of works synergistically with BPC57. Um,
Dr. Naomi Myhill: That's an interesting name.
Vivek Chander: so
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Wolverine Protocol. What's the origins of that?
Vivek Chander: I'm not sure. I don't know if it has to do with the movie or not. I don't know.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah.
Vivek Chander: Um, but yeah, it's it's also like one of these ones that uh,
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Wow.
Vivek Chander: you know, may make sense to do before like a PRP injection. Um, one the the next one I think is like a really good one to have like in our arsenal and like I'm excited about it. I haven't, you know, kind of played around with this one myself yet, but alpha thyosin one. Um, it's used internationally. It's not FDA approved in the US, but of all of them out there, it has the most robust uh randomized control uh data out there.
 
 
00:13:58
 
Vivek Chander: Um, it's used for pretty regularly for like chronic viral infections. Uh, like I mentioned before, it's really good for vaccine response enhancement. Um, people are using it for like as part of like immune therapy protocols for cancer patients as well. Um, so it it's the most exciting one in a way because it has the most robust clinical data of all of them. Um, uh, it tends to reduce like a lot of the pro-inflammatory cytoinins. Um, minimal side effects. Again, it's safe in immune compromised patients. um for longevity purposes. It's it's supposed to improve age related immune decline. Um it's good for patients with autoimmune diseases as well. Um not FDA approved. Like I said, people there's this whole there's this whole concept that uh peptides should be used seasonally. There's a woman by the name of Elizabeth Yurtth who like has made an argument saying that like in every like our body goes to these natural kind of ups and downs and there's like times when we should be using these peptides and like a perfect timing for this one specifically would be right before like between August and October before you get your vaccines because you get your flu and COVID vaccines typically in October.
 
 
00:15:52
 
Vivek Chander: um because it helps like improve the odds that those vaccines will work. So like I I find that really interesting actually. Um so that's alpha thymus one. Uh the next one I would talk about is CJC1295 which is a growth hormone releasing hormone analog. Uh it's not FDA approved. Um it helps with body composition optimization. It helps with age related growth hormone decline. It enhances sleep quality. uh specifically it enhances deep sleep so the slowwave sleep. Uh it it actually supports the breakdown of fat. It promotes lean muscle development. Um this would be one kind of in a seasonal context like you would want to use in the spring u because that's kind of when the body's kind of almost regenerating itself a little bit. Uh best time to take a lot of these are at bedtime. Like uh a lot of the growth hormone ones you want to take at least like 90 minutes after eating something and then like right before bedtime essentially. That's like the uh where you're going to get the most efficient use of the peptide.
 
 
00:17:29
 
Vivek Chander: Um it can cause water retention a little bit. Um, if you do have diabetes, it can worsen diabetes and if you have sleep apnea, I think it can make it worse. So, you have to be careful in those uses. Um, uh, again like with a lot of these like if you have active cancer, you want to stay stay away from it. Uh, in terms of the diabetes, if you have a hemoglobin A1C greater than 5.7, I would stay away from it. Sleep apnea, I would stay away from it. All of these you want to stay away from if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. Um, also water prohibited. It's often used like, you know, just like the Wolverine protocol, you get, you know, you have the two of them together. This one's often paired with eparlin. Um, so like there's all like all these peptide stacks with CJC and Emeral and they work synergistically with each other. Um, so that's CJC. Keep on going.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: if you've got any more top of mind.
 
 
00:18:50
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: If not,
Vivek Chander: Oh,
Dr. Naomi Myhill: we can move on to the Well,
Vivek Chander: there are a ton of them.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: let let's go through them.
Vivek Chander: All
Dr. Naomi Myhill: I think it's I think it's useful for us like if we don't get through everything in this interview and we
Vivek Chander: right.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: we'll just do a part two to finish it. So, let's not worry too much about time.
Vivek Chander: Sure.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: I'd rather get into the detail so we can gather all that for Cascade.
Vivek Chander: Okay. Um, eparlin. Um, this one actually is a growth hormone releasing peptide. So it stimulates uh secretion of growth hormone. I I tend to like the ones that So so the CJC is actually like a growth hormone analog, right? So you're actually giving somebody growth hormone whereas it's actually stimulating your body to produce the growth hormone. And I like that concept much more um to be honest with you. I like I think it's just a little bit more natural.
 
 
00:19:44
 
Vivek Chander: Um but also you know used for growth hormone optimization, body composition improvement, sleep quality, um very well tolerated. Um it does make you feel hungry. So another reason to use at night time um uh because if you have it earlier in the day, it definitely stimulates your appetite for sure. Um so again used for sleep quality enhancement, body composition optimization. Um that's essentially like the highlights there. Uh the next one is actually one that is probably the most commonly used in the United States. Serellin. Um so you see a lot of tele medicine companies using curlin and tesmarellum also growth hormone releasing hormone used to be FDA approved. So it's previously FDA approved and I think that's why it's one of the more commonly prescribed ones because there's like an error of legitimacy to it. Uh not that all these are not legitimate. I think all of them unfortunately suffer from similar issues with not having a lot of good human RCT data but a lot of them have like a lot of mechanistic support as well as a lot of kind of animal studies that support it.
 
 
00:21:10
 
Vivek Chander: Um this one um uh you know people use for again sleep quality improvement, body composition optimization. Um it directly stimulates release of growth hormone from the pituitary. Um uh this one should be cycled because what ends up happening is you end up desensitizing the receptors. So uh typically you'll want to use it for two or three months on and then one or two months off and then kind of rotate it. from a uh seasonal perspective. Again, it's a good one to use in the spring uh maybe uh into the summer. Um as you're kind of outside working out, you a little bit more active. Um it has a pretty short halflife. Um which is actually good for all of them. Um again you stay away from people with cancer, diabetes, sleep apnea, pregnancy, breastfeeding, water prohibited. Uh that's sarlan tessamellin is uh like another I'll call this one out as being like a little bit more high value than most because it is actually FDA approved right now uh for HIV associated lipodistrophe.
 
 
00:22:40
 
Vivek Chander: Um so it is available through prescription and compoundingarmacies. It has the a longest halflife of all the growth hormone secrets. Um this one I've personally kind of considered using specifically for the fact that like I know that I have uh like in my last dexa scan it showed that I had a lot of visceral um fat. This one actually is great for getting rid of rid of that visceral fat u and redistri redistributing the body composition. Um it also apparently is great for like things like brain fog and cognitive function. Um it increases IGF-1. It enhances collagen synthesis. uh also should be given at that time. Pretty safe. Same sort of contraindications. No cancer, no diabetes, no pregnancy, lactation, sleep apnea. Um, that's most of test moral, but that that's one that I would put like top of list in terms of what we could use at Cascade because it is FDA approved. And even though we're using this for off label use and all of these things are going to require informed consent, the fact that it's FDA approved makes it a little safer to kind of use broadly.
 
 
00:24:18
 
Vivek Chander: Um a lot of people are using GHK copper for uh skin um purposes. Um it helps with skin aging as well as like uh repair from uh photoagging. Um also people are using it for hair loss. It stimulates collagen production. It's anti-inflammatory. Um, the most common way of using this is topically. It's pretty well tolerated. Pretty safe to use long term. People are using it for wrinkles, firmness, texture, scar improvement, hair regrowth, wound healing. Um it's pretty evidence-based which is good. Uh a lot of people are combining it with retinoids and vitamin C um for their kind of sk like daily skin routines. That's that one. Um KPV uh is not FDA approved. Um, so my my daughter Marina has inflammatory bowel disease. So I always call this stuff out because of her. It is really good for intestinal inflammation and repair. People have leaky gut or SIBO or con, you know, chronic bloating, IBD. Um, it's pretty anti-inflammatory at the gut lining, which is great.
 
 
00:26:02
 
Vivek Chander: Um, it is used orally, which is great. like a lot of I think every other one we've talked about is subcutaneous. This one is used orally. Um the BPC57 for tissue repair is subcutaneous but for gut issues it is oral and KPC is often used in combination with BPC 157 for like a gut reset. Um, I think there's like a product in the market called Gut Tides, uh, which if you use for four to eight weeks, it kind of just resets the gut and, uh, makes like all the junctions tight and, uh, like cures leaky gut. Uh, you know, I haven't, it's kind of on my things to experiment with uh, for Marina if she ever gets ever needs it, but we haven't used it. Uh there are a lot of people who suffer from SIBO. So like this would be like a good one to use for for that as well. Um this one has ongoing uh RCTs going on right now. Laura laorazzide uh which is potentially going to be used for patients who have celiac disease.
 
 
00:27:24
 
Vivek Chander: Um it um uh essentially the the idea is that from what I understand is that if you're celiac you won't be able it's not going to cure your celiac disease but the use case is going to be folks with celiac who go out to a restaurant and they accidentally get cross-contaminated with something. This is one of those medications that may help prevent like a flare or an inflammatory flare because of that. So I guess like 1% of the population is celiac. So this this would would actually help with that. Um it's supposed to be used before eating obviously so that that it prevents it's almost like um you know lactate, right? So you would use like a lactate before eating ice cream. This would be have this half an hour before you go and to a restaurant to prevent any crosscontamination flare. Um uh let's see. Um the the ne Oh, this is this is good. So, I didn't talk about um MOT C uh which is a mitochondrial targeted peptide, but like the one I I do want to talk about is SS31 because SS31 was just FDA approved last month for BART syndrome.
 
 
00:28:59
 
Vivek Chander: Uh which is this disorder that uh your your mitochondria doesn't function. Um so this is primarily used for mitochond mitochondrial enhancement. Uh it helps with uh it restores ATP production. So people like it'll help with energy levels. Um uh it should help with people who are going through like cardiovascular disease, heart failure. Um it improves like cellular kind of energy levels. So it it's it's a good one to know about just because again it does have FDA approval associated with it. Uh it should enhance athletic performance and recovery. Um it should also help with aging related mitochondrial decline. Um I think this one is expensive. Uh and there you go. There's so many. There probably like 20 more.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Wow.
Vivek Chander: But I think but I think those are like the the ones that are commonly being
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Wow. Yeah, that was great.
Vivek Chander: used.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: I think that's that's kind of exactly what we need because those would probably be the the ones we'd focus on at at Cascade.
 
 
00:30:19
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: So, we gather that information. All All of the other ones would be useful to have, but maybe that could be something you can send over like the the kind of information you have on that and then we can kind of bring those in. Um, that would be super useful. Just the last one was is that also um on the wider band list as well?
Vivek Chander: Uh I assume that they all are. Um the Bart syndrome like it's so ba basic like
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah.
Vivek Chander: it's pretty cool because like this disease it's a genetic disorder where like the mitochondria just don't function. So kids end up dying of like heart failure and cardiammyopathy because they just can't make any energy, cellular energy. So like this is a prime example of like these things are just not studied and if you do the studies there all these amazing use cases that do have RCTs behind them and it works and it's actually making meaningful difference for patients. So it's really
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, that's awesome.
 
 
00:31:23
 
Vivek Chander: cool.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Are there any other peptide classes you think would be commonly used or maybe relevant for our kind of Cascade health seekers and the the type of health seekers we would have come in the doors at
Vivek Chander: Yeah, there's one.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Cascade?
Vivek Chander: So there's a whole class of peptides that we haven't talked about which is kind of for for sexual functioning. There's definitely things like kiss pectin. I know that there's actually one additional FDA approved peptide called PT-141 u that's used for um hyposexual arousal disorder like so um there are there is another class of peptides out there specifically to enhance um desire um and function um that I don't know too much about just yet. Uh, but I do know that PT141 is actually FDA approved. Um, Vilacassi is like the brand name of it. Um, so that would be something potentially that would be of interest to Cascade patients for sure.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Great. Okay. Um, so it's great to hear kind of how the how the uh the constructs map to some of those peptides.
 
 
00:32:58
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: um when a health seeker or or a patient kind of presents with a concern, how do you typically assess whether a peptide is appropriate as a response to that? So as well as like what symptoms, biomarkers, patterns make you then consider peptides as an
Vivek Chander: Um,
Dr. Naomi Myhill: option.
Vivek Chander: so to date we know that a lot of these peptides have been used in Russia for years and years and years. To date, we know that people are using these peptides off label in the United States and patients are sourcing these by themselves often to you know from you know places in China and you know a friend of a friend in a completely non-compliant notsafe way. Um and to date we know that in the United States uh there are pharmacies that are you know 503A and B producing these peptides uh under like a research use only or physician use only uh like uh way. So there there are not a lot of um evidence-based protocols that have been developed as of yet in terms of how these should be used.
 
 
00:34:38
 
Vivek Chander: Um, I think I did call out specifically uh Elizabeth Yurts uh like in having this uh potential uh construct I guess of using these peptides in a um in a seasonal way. Um let me see if I can kind of use the terminology. I did pull up her her um lecture earlier today. Yeah. So the way she thinks of it is that uh for a seasonal peptide strategy in the winter uh think of it as repair and conservation. So the peptides would be geared towards that. In the spring would be anabolic and regeneration. um in the summer maintenance and immune optimization and in the autumn preparation and metabolic priming. Um I love that context. Uh, and I think that in terms of what we would do to um to figure out where to go, like I think that sleep optimization is super important. It's at one of the baseline kind of longevity uh pyramid framework, right? And so like following sleep uh parameters, you know, whether it be through like any of the wearables uh to see if we can optimize sleep would be something that I would consider like uh smearlan, tesmarellin, cjc to help optimize sleep.
 
 
00:36:25
 
Vivek Chander: Uh I think for body comp like following DEXA scans um if you know that like I think I mentioned that I have you know two and a half pounds of visceral fat. The fact that I know that like makes me think that I should use tessellin knowing that it would not only um not only uh uh you know remove the fat from my liver but potentially also help with uh muscle uh buildup. So, you know, you know, that that's really interesting. Um, I'm sure you, you know, with all the like the Kiss pectin and the PT-141, uh, a lot of that is just subjectively based. So, if you're having, uh, challenges, then I think that would be something to kind of experiment with for arousal and, uh, function. Um, I think things like PPC 157 and TV400, again, there's no evidence-based protocols, but if you have an injury, uh, and there's a low downside, why not? uh things like COVID. There are a couple of these things that help with COVID. So, if you have prolonged cough and brain fog for, you know, a month after COVID, I think that that would be something that we could look at to potentially try uh like develop a protocol um to help treat that.
 
 
00:38:07
 
Vivek Chander: Um but there are no there's no specific lab tests I guess um except for like the broader you know you know how we've developed these kind of um the extensive kind of lab tests to like follow uh inflammatory markers and um homoyine levels. those will help point the way a little bit, but there's nothing specific to like really grab grab on to and like uh say that oh their, you know, um inflammatory their CRP is 77, we should treat it with that. There's nothing like that with peptides.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: That's interesting. Just quite a developing area in terms of there isn't that many standardized protocols around for how you would prescribe them. Is there I suppose is there an effect of whether the health seekers kind of current state indicates if they're ready for that peptide therapy? Like are there any any indication of any baseline thresholds that do matter that you would look at just a general level of are they ready right now? Like if they're if they're suffering from like a cold or something like that in that period of time, would you delay depending on what peptides you're going to use?
 
 
00:39:33
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: So yeah, I guess does the health seekers current state at that time influence decision- making around that?
Vivek Chander: Well, I you know, if like I I think that the most and I and I think that this aligns with Cascad's philosophy a little bit is that I think if we think of this as like really a a pyramid, right? So, you fix the lifestyle issues first, right? those are fixed and then you fix like the supplementation and you know the the targeted medical intervention second and then it's really about precision, right? Then it's like how do we make potential changes to optimize each person because we know that there's no heard group kind of evidence-based protocol. So, how do we how do we optimize what you need right now? Right? And I think that's where peptide therapy comes in. It's a case-bycase thing. You cannot make any medical claims to any of it. So, it's all like educative with patients, right? BPC57 has had mouth studies that shown that this can occur.
 
 
00:40:56
 
Vivek Chander: like you can't say that it's going to help with your your um tissues regenerating. You c you can't say that it's going to help with uh your specific angioenesis, right, of uh in and tissue repair, but you can say that it has helped mice. So like all of these things are going to need really good informed consent, all of them. So, I don't know. Like, somebody's having poor sleep. Boom. Let's try test testolin. You're having poor sleep and you have visceral fat. That's like the perfect one for you, right? Um, you're going to get vaccines in October. This would be like a great time to do this. Uh, with alpha thymusin one, let's enhance your vaccine effectiveness. Has it been shown? It actually has been shown. There are studies, but it's not FDA approved. Here's your consent. Sign it. Right. So, there it's a hard qu You're asking a very hard question. I'm not sure like it really comes down to patient to patient.
 
 
00:42:08
 
Vivek Chander: It comes down to uh actually building trust with the patient, having a conversation with the patient and going through shared decision- making because it's not really a a proof therapeutic. So, it's like it has to there has to be an element of they're going to come to us, they're going to say, "Hey, I know that my friend is using this. Why can't I use this?" And it's going to be a conversation of of what the education shows and then do you want to use it? It's not me prescribing it in a way. It's if you want to use it, you need to know these are the positives. These are the negatives. This is not FDA approved. This is completely off label. Uh if you want to use it, we will get it for you. But you you know I sign you
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, that makes sense. It's a difficult question to give a give an answer to. So, so I appreciate the context around that. Um, so for the peptides that you mentioned that would probably be most relevant what Cascade Health seekers would be would be interested in. Um, can you go into a bit more detail and maybe describe the mechanism of action in in some of those?
 
 
00:43:28
 
Dr. Naomi Myhill: So for BPC157 that you've mentioned like how how does that
Vivek Chander: Sure.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: accelerate kind of repair or modulate inflammation I guess and like some examples of how what the actual mechanism is in some of these peptides would be be good for us to know.
Vivek Chander: So with BPC157 um it actually will increase the growth hormone receptors at the site of the injury. So if you increase the number of receptors there, you have an injury and then all of a sudden you're using something like serarellin to increase growth hormone production. So they work synergistically where the growth hormone will come to the knee injury. Let's say it'll target those receptors and and uh it'll help kind of repair just that I mean that's what growth hormone does. It's one of the uh primary hormones used to kind of repair injuries, right? Um it increases the stimulation of like endothelial cells, so angioenesis. It will bring blood supply uh and cap like it'll build capillaries into the injured area and bring blood supply which will also bring the growth hormone and and like uh bring bring the hormone to where it needs essentially.
 
 
00:44:56
 
Vivek Chander: Um it reduces cytoinins. So like if you have like if you can reduce like the inflammatory cytoinins again that helps with pain scores and it also in effect allows for like the growth hormone to get in there and work its magic. Um th those are some of the mechanisms of action I guess.
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah, that's great. I think for us that's important so we can draw that information into into ontology as well so we understand how it's working too. um when these kind of peptide therapies are are prescribed, what are the kind of key steps that you would use or that should be used to ensure that kind of consistent I suppose safe initiation or is it a similar answer to before where there's not really any kind of protocols present in terms of that. So I suppose what we're looking for here is like a step by step of what would be the process in terms of the guidance, the education, um any common mistakes that are made when um offering this as an option for health seekers and then maybe what the monitoring plan would be from that during that process.
 
 
00:46:24
 
Vivek Chander: Yeah. Uh so I think step by step the first thing I would say is that the you know Cascade is uh operating nationally right now. Correct. or aim to be operating nationally is my guess. Right?
Dr. Naomi Myhill: I'll show
Vivek Chander: So there are statebystate specific rules
Dr. Naomi Myhill: you.
Vivek Chander: on guidance in terms of these of all of these. So I'll tell you that for instance BPC57 they're probably about 15 to 20 states that uh have already had like regulatory letters sent to pharmacies to stop uh prescribing them. So the first layer of what I would do is uh there's there are a number of uh lawyers who um who specialize in this space and I actually did uh forward Resh a couple of these lawyers. But that would be step one is to get the legal guidance and the legal framework in and build the compliance piece. Right? The most important thing of the compliance piece will be the consent for sure. Right? So it will be uh you know had a 30-minute conversation with the patient.
 
 
00:47:46
 
Vivek Chander: We we educated on how these uh peptides mechanistically are felt to work. And uh after after uh having that conversation, we had a conversation about potential drug interactions and side effects and uh you know the fact that these increase the chance of cancer. So if there's any unknown cancer in your body, there's a possibility that using these medications would make it worse. Um so again with legal guidance we need to build out that that consent. So that's like step one honestly. Um that's the most important thing in my mind. Right. Um then I think you're absolutely right. You you prescribe the peptide. We are going to have to vet where these peptides come from. They're going to have to come from the right pharmacies. Um, ideally I think that again just given kind of compliance legal risks, it probably makes sense for the peptides not to go to cascade and then go from the cascade to the uh patient. It probably makes sense for the medications to go directly from the pharmacy to the patient.
 
 
00:49:12
 
Vivek Chander: Um, I think at that point we probably should have like maybe a one month, three month, one-year check-in or like a lot of these are going to be cycled. So maybe I don't know, let me think about this. I would probably have a check-in after the first injection. I would probably have a check-in at month one and I would probably have a check-in when like if I if you remember I kind of mentioned that these should be cycled. So let's say that the cycled time for the specific peptide is 3 months. I would have a check-in at the time at the end to remind them that they need to cycle off and see, you know, maybe kind of capture what they're feeling, how they're feeling, uh, you know, any any side effects, uh, any positive effects, how they feel, do they feel better, their experience with the with the, um, with that specific peptide? Um, I think that would be like a good way to monitor. I also think that in terms of like especially the ones that improve body composition, uh, I think in general pro I don't think we need more frequent DEXA scans than once a year. Um, but that would be part of the protocol with these, I think, would be to incorporate a DEXA scan at least yearly, maybe before you use it, and then like a year after, kind of cycling on, off, on and off, just to see how the body comp data has changed. Yeah. Is that was
Dr. Naomi Myhill: Yeah. No, that's great. I've just seen the seen the time. There's a lot more a lot more follow-up questions that I have um just around the the interpretation
Vivek Chander: that
Dr. Naomi Myhill: of of those kind of monitoring assessments and and kind of selection logic and and other types of interventions you might do alongside peptides and things like that. So, I think we're going to need a a part two um for that one to carry on. But um I'll stop the recording on this one now. So, we've just got to time and we'll just stop
Vivek Chander: Okay. You wanted to
